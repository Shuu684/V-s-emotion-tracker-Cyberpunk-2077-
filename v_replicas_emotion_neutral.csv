Thought he was bulletproof and… and that he'd become legend at the Afterlife. And ultimately, he did what he set out to do - shit in the shoes of some powerful people.

"You even get any customers out here? Shit, anyone even drive this way?",anger,fear

"And it was rare as fuck and cost a fortune, yeah.",anger,anger
How exactly was this new version supposed to work? Were you planning to have the engram kick people out of their own bodies? Is that shit by design?,anger,fear

What was it like? When you died?,neutral,neutral
"They fuckin' around with the human mind, consciousness.",anger,anger
"Y'know what I always liked about nomads? Your taste, uh, no - your hunger for freedom. It's not easy to come by In Night City. The corps got their grubby claws in everything. And I just can't believe you'd hand them what you hold to be most precious.",neutral,surprise
"Yea-I, buhh... I-I'm sorry... Dunno what I was thinking...",sadness,sadness
Thought the Biotechnica contract had withered and died.,neutral,sadness

"All right then, count me in. But I gotta warn ya - I look great in a wetsuit.",joy,joy
Look pretty damn fine in that wetsuit.,anger,anger
Why's this stand to be perfect?,neutral,neutral
Where you used to run as a kid. Where daily life grinded along. Can imagine it a bit.,neutral,fear

Whoa... Askin' me to move in?,neutral,neutral
"Hate to interrupt, but...",anger,anger
It fuckin' worked!,anger,anger

Wait... ya think she's complicit in Saburo's murder?,neutral,neutral
Hate Night City that much?,neutral,neutral
"Oh, can you run and grab us a pizza?",neutral,neutral
"Feline ghost? Ah, suppose anything's possible.",neutral,joy
Miss home?,neutral,neutral

Finally startin' to make some sense.,neutral,joy
Fuck... gettin' worse...,anger,anger

I'm sorry that we have to speak under such... circumstances.,sadness,sadness
Why? My word mean shit to you?,anger,fear
"Oh, shut up, Goro! Was s'posed to be honest. Well, that's what I'm bein'! Fine, maybe I am just a two-bit thief... but I'm the two-bit thief that stole that fuckin' Relic off you. Slotted it in, took a bullet to the brain, died...",anger,fear
"Oh yeah. And now I got Johnny fuckin' Silverhand in there, and I'll do anything to get him out. So I got exactly nothin' to lose. But you got lots.",anger,fear
"Look, I know it's a lot to take in, let alone believe. Also know you're an honorable person, worthy of trust. And that's why I wanna make you an offer.",sadness,sadness
"Yeah. I stole the relic Yorinobu tried to peddle off on NetWatch. While Iw as makin' my escape, got a bullet to the brain... Relic saved me. Now the damn thing's killin' me. And I gotta stop it.",anger,anger
Oh shit...,neutral,neutral
"Yep, just two fuckin' losers. And I thought we were screwed when Goro kidnapped Hanako.",anger,anger
Shut your gonk mouth. Please. Sayin' random shit ain't gonna help anyone.,anger,fear
Any word from Goro? We split up when we went on the run.,neutral,fear
Damn shame you didn't believe me earlier. Goro might've still been alive had you.,anger,anger
"I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you, painful.",sadness,sadness
"Have to send a swarm of proxies to do that. This here, talkin', is because you're alone. You don't have anyone else you can turn to.",sadness,sadness
"C'mon, think about it. Yesterday Hanako was living in a world that was completely safe for her. What's she got on her hands now? A foreign city, a homicidal brother and a fuckin' thief. It's why she sent a proxy. She's alone. And she's shittin' herself more than we are.",sadness,fear
Glad you're in one piece.,joy,joy
No way of knowin' for sure. All we have's her word.,neutral,surprise

Had enough of this fuckin' around! Tell 'em the concert's off now!,anger,anger
You look great.,joy,joy
Glad we get this moment to ourselves.,joy,joy
It's time you stopped bein' afraid. You don't need to.,fear,fear
Nice axe.,neutral,joy
"Heh, chaos and destruction? Why the fuck not.",anger,anger

Great idea. They can go straight to Yorinobu and ask him what happened at Konpeki Plaza. Just make sure they're armed. Your boss starts strangling people when he gets mad.,joy,joy
