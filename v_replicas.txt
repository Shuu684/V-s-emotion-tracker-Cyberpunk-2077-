Urgh, motherfucker!
Some bastard tried to mug me. I handled it.
Ya really think somebody local'd try to mug me, Pepe?
C'mon, spin it - what is it now?
You in it with Kirk?! Every man, woman and rat in Heywood knows he's a fuckin' shark.
I'll talk to Kirk. But then you're gonna owe me one.
Hey, Kirk. Wanna talk.
Pepe asked me to talk you up.
Hell's your problem?  What's he owe ya?
A credshark with business ethics. Sounds too good to be true.
Cut him some slack, will ya? He'll pay - just needs some more time.
No, you let him off because it's me askin'.
Know what, Kirk? I sometimes get the impression you forget you aren't from around here. Pop into Heywood for the occasional visit, sure, but you live far, far away in Pacifica.
Gettin' at you prolly needin' to think before you start somethin' with a local son.
What's this?
Mhm…?
Uh huh. And four?
I do this and Pepe's debt is squared?
Who's the owner?
And his name?
Plan sounds shaky as fuck.
Sounds like you're lookin' for a sucker.
And your man Rick…?
How'm I supposed to do this? Expect me to slide under the chassis on or skateboard for a quick hotwire, fast an' easy? Kirk, wheels like this got security systems. Good ones.
A Skeleton key for all Rayfields in the city. Heh, c'mon, Kirk, even you don't buy that.
Best keep your word, Kirk.
Right, so then what? So you're a vet today, huh?
Yep, no place like home… Sebastian Ibarro - haven't changed a smidge.
How're things, Padre?
Got back from Atlanto a few weeks ago.
Tell ya later, got somethin' on my plate…
The Glen. Drop me off at Embers.
Take the ramp back of the bar. Show you where to stop.
Er, two years gone by, not much has changed.
Ehh, pick up somethin' here and there. Nothin' major. But I'm gettin' by. 'Preciate the concern.
As you can see, I'm back. If it'd been better there, wouldn't've left.
What's goin' on?
One more fuckin' word…
And I don't know you, which means you're worth shit around here and capable of even less. Well? Anything else?
Who was that?
He pulled iron on you.
Pull up here. Right here. I'll just drop down below.
Your number?
Thanks, Padre. Gotta go.
On location. About to find your man.
Yeah. So you said.
Kirk sent me.
Kirk? I see the ride.
Let's take this piece of wondertech for a whirl.
Hm… Looks like this'll be a cool breeze.
What the…?
OK, easy.
What, man, never heard of thieves' honor? Finders keepers? I was first.
Wha-What're you doin'?
How about that, ugh - a pig that chatters.
You know fuck all about me.
Motherfucker… Agh!
Nah, Stints wouldn't do us like that.
Mhm. He's Heywood-born, bred and grown like us, Hates suits as much as you do. Did what he had to do, that's it.
Nah, c'mon. Job was toxic from the start. Even Kabuki under the counter magic can't get around an alarm like that. Shoulda known I'd have the PD on my ass.
V.
Wait, Welles… like Mama Welles. Heh, thought I recognized the name.
Got the job to steal those wheels at the Coyote. From Kirk.
Pepe owes him big and can't afford to pay, so I stepped up.
Heard what they say - he's backed by cartels.
Just like that? You put a barrel to my skull not so long ago.
None at all.
'Bout what?
OK, food it is. Let's go.
Militech? Jack, we're talkin' classified, military-grade tech here. How'd you get it?
Why? Thinks she knows better?
Sure, why the hell not.
Wakako give you any tips and tricks for the job?
Let's do this.
Bug, ya could at least try to be… nice.
Sandro Dorsett's protected under echelon II corpo immunity. Our girl's top shelf… This one's packin’ black market Zetotech repros. Typical back alley fix-ups. Not our lucky gal. Let's keep lookin'.
Shit, where the hell's our target?!
Jesus fuckin' Christ…
Think I got her. Got our target.
About to find out.
She's in a tub of ice… crammed in with another. Fuck - like slabs of meat!
Heard people who live through shit like this get panic attacks. ‘Thout ever knowin' why… You'll be sippin' a glass of ice-cold water and suddenly your hand's shakin'.
Jackin' in. Sandra Dorsett. NC570442. Trauma Team Platinum.
Is that even safe…? Can't we just get her outta here?
Found the shard. Removing now.
Biomon claims Trauma'll be here in three minutes.
Jack, look sharp, not done yet. Don't know who's out there.
Aw, fuck!
Jackie, airhypo! Fuck, this is bad!
I think… Holy shit, it worked!
Hmmm…
Won't leave you hangin’, Jack. But don't get used to it.
She's all yours. I'm beat as it is.
'Course she's alive and well. That's what we agreed, isn't it?
Thanks for the heads-up. Swing by to see you later.
Word's out the NCPD's gonna put Watson on lockdown. If I'm gonna sleep in my own bed tonight, we better put it in fifth.
City like any other. Just bigger.
Jackie - they're lockin' down Watson, 'member?
Fuckin' drive, Jackie!
Can't! Keep her steady!
It's OK - It can wait. Let's just focus on gettin' home.
Look at 'im. No model citizen, maybe, but he's a good kid.
So you can be nice when you feel like it.
Umm… always?
Doesn't look like your average bust…
What about you? Not likely to make it back to Heywood now…
Sure about that?
Tell Misty I said "Hi."
Bug?
Think I might caught somethin'. When I jacked into that corpo's biomon… Dunno, a neurovirus or… Need to see Vik. Let him tell me what's got my head reelin' and my stomach churnin’.
How'd you find me? How'd you even know my name?
Where'd you get 'im, Fred?
How's it goin’? Fights about to start. Not gonna watch, take notes?
Let's do this.
You go in the ring yourself?
There's ways of fixin' that. Kerenzikov should do the trick.
You mentioned somethin' about fighting?
Yeah, lucrative for who? You or me?
Oh, I get it. You wanna get rich off my blood, sweat and tears.
Crystal.
What've you got for sale?
Didn't figure you as the type for Asian. Woulda thought you'd find it too exotic.
Mentioned somethin' about a surprise yesterday. 'M I rememberin' right or… just had a brain fart?
Go on…
Thought Dex bounced outta the ring a few years ago. Messed with a nosty crew in Pacifica, things got ugly.
Guy's up to his elbows in blood, Jack. And you wanna shake his hand, work with him?
How'd you manage to pull this? Trade in your spleen or somethin'? For as know, we're not the type to get fingered by Dex.
Heh, sure, Jack. Whatever you say. So what's the gig? We meant to come out in one piece.
Why do I gotta go? You and T-Bug draw straws without me.
Guess I got no choice, then.
Don't get me started on fixers. They catch a client, find the cheapest gonk to do the job, then drop their corpse at a landfill.
Thanks, Jack. Much appreciated.
We'll see about that…
Let's feel this factory-new ride.
You don't say…
If anyone was watchin' and givin' a damn, I'd have half the city's underworld and half its corps on my ass already.
Viky, spry as ever, you old ripper. It's good to see you.
Last gig - had to Jack into a client's neurosocket… Think I mighta gotten spiked.
Whole kit and kaboodle.
Met a new fixer, he gave me a job. Name's Dexter DeShawn.
But? Something you're not tellin' me, Vik?
Need some new kit - but tools, not toys, Vik. Time I bumped up my sights and got a grip.
Vik, shit's gettin' real. Got a job from Dex DeShawn - hittin' the major leagues. Need tech that can perform.
Quit cryin’, Vik. I'll bring you the eddies later. With interest. You know I will.
Kiroshi? Whoa! Vik, nothin' tops that on the market.
Gave you my word I'd pay you back, but this… might be too rich for my blood.
I'm ready. Carve away.
So… what's new in the life of Viktor Vektor?
And what happened?
Play by play, though? Really, doc? Makes you sound like a dentist - always goin' on and on…
Seen more dramatic improvements before…
How 'bout the neurovirus, from the last job? Can ya check it?
Shit, Viktor, not bad. I dunno what to say.
What'm I lookin' at?
Thanks again, Vik, you're the best. I owe you.
Who's winning?
Got cash ridin' on this?
Miss it, don't you.
How's biz going?
Good thing you got Misty here to help. Handles your gripping well.
Know what? Seems like you're the only person in Night City who's happy with his lot.
OK, do my best to talk us up.
Riiiiight.
Hmm…
You been with Misty a while, huh?
Just askin'. Never thought you'd lost that long in a stable, healthy relationship.
How's your mom?
Something happen?
Hey, how well you know Bug, exactly?
Right.
Dexter DeShawn in the flesh. Ample, indeed.
You're either somebody on you fizzle out into nothin'. Night City don't let you choose.
Hang on. I got a question of my own, now. Why all this, Dex? Why me? Coulda had Jackie or T-Bug sittin' here. Coulda just done this on comms…
Lemme hear it - what's the job?
Yeah…? Huh, guessin' it belongs to a corp.
No, no problem. Just a death sentence. NC's Arasakas turf, nobody fucks with them here.
You work this out? Got a plan?
What's the issue needs resolvin’ with Maelstrom? Got a beef?
Royce guy - what's he like?
Big club in this town.
Who's the prima donna?
Client. What's her thing? Why's she need to meet?
Right, and…?
Think I got everything. Time I got to work.
Jackster. Talked to Dex.
Guy certainly knows how to protect his biz. Wants to put us on a few small kinks, prep work, I guess, before linin' us up a big job. There's this combat bot, military prototype. Maelstrom klepped it. Then Dex paid to take it off their hands just before the gangoons had a switch up in management.
'Bout sums it up. Dex wants us talkin' to Royce. Gave the deets of some Militech agent, too, but… I dunno how much help she stands to be.
Ick, you don't sound thrilled. Royce - whaddaya know about him?
Then there's the other thing, Gotta meet the client who put the job on the table - Evelyn Parker.
Parker wants to meet someone on the crew. Dex gave me the nod.
Parker - think oughta see her first. See what she's like, what she's after.
Whaddaya got?
Clearly know how to sell it.
Bespoke - damn, that sounds promising. I get it, I'm in.
I really look that green to you? Like I don't know…?
Hey.
So… curious. The name "Lizzie's" is that the owner?
Now I'm just flat interested.
Ah, stories of the golden days. Inevitable demise and the inevitable drink over sweet memories.
So, what went wrong?
Tygers gave this place up to the Mox in the end though, didn't they?
I'm lookin' for Evelyn Parker. You know if she's here?
A big tipper. Generous when I get the answers I'm lookin' for.
Centzon? Only tequila I drink. Hm. How would you know?
Why we meetin' here? Any particular reason? Actually, doesn't seem much like your thing, this place.
You don't give a rat's dick what Dex thinks. We both know that.
No. Just think flattery's beneath you. Am I wrong?
You writin' Dex's bio? Hate to disappoint, but I just don't know much.
Shit, buzz Dex right now if you're gettin' cold feet - I can wait.
Let's… cut to the chase. Whaddaya got for me?
Relic. "Secure Your Soul" trinket. Key tech in the program, actually. We're tangling with Arasaka. Makin' this heist one dangerous, risky motherfucker.
Classy corp hotels? Yeah, no. Outta my price range.
So where's this chip hiding, exactly?
Yorinobu Arasaka? He's in town?
What, so Arasaka Junior's plannin' to grab the reins while in Night City?
Telling me you're one of 'em? So we're not jumpin' the corp. We're jumping Yorinobu Arasaka himself.
Top dog like Yorinobu's bound to have an army on call. Hotel's prolly a goddamn fortress by now, too.
Huh. Why's that?
Look, if you've got any spare oces up your sleeve, now's the time to show 'em.
So what's Yorinobu due to walk away with?
What could cyberspace's watchers and protectors offer him? Intelligence on his enemies?
Wait - neutral NetWatch is mixed up in this?
Fine, so no Arasaka security on the device 'cause Yorinobu whisked it away in secret. Now, where's he hidin' it?
And the case is…?
What else you know about Yorinobu?
Could just be another power-hungry corpodick. Like so many others.
And one you plan to exploit fully. One more thing. Data that's on the chip - what is it?
We're talkin' about data Yorinobu snuck out of Arasaka. What's more, he wants to pass it onto NetWatch. Sounds pretty damn relevant to me.
OK. What's next?
How's a braindance supposed to help? Need facts, not thrills.
So what's on the tape?
Hold up… Mean to say you recorded this?
Supposed to be Yorinobu's pad on the tape. Means you were inside. You know each other?
Let's see this braindance.
Relax. Believe it or not, I'm no stranger to tact. In biz or life.
Sensory sig amps, acoustic and emotive wave monitors… Top-shelf hardware.
Mod all this yourself?
Expression translator - Fuyutsuki, right? Thought the matrices on that series were fucked up.
What d'you mean by "raw"? How's this differ from the ready-mades?
A what profile now?
Mhm. And worst case?
OK. Hit me. Just promise me it won't hurt.
Mhm…
Am I gonna have to do this calibration dance every time?
What'd you choose?
Boot it up.
That flash of… intense shock. Can still feel it, I remember… Fuck, that last second… Ya coulda warned me how much it hurts to die.
Not so sure about that.
Unbelievable. Seriously. Like it was happening right next to me.
Like what?
Huh, hella nice.
Dunno, I… Let's take a break. Still feel like that kid when… Phew, yeah think I'm done.
OK, OK… Go ahead… Just need T-Bug to link in.
Runner from my crew, security specialist. She'll tell me what to look for while we analyze. No problem, I hope?
Relax, Judy. Everything'll be fine.
We're all takin' risks here. That's the job. So either T-Bug patches in, or I'm on my way out.
Bug, listen. I got some useful footage from Konpeki Plaza. It's a braindance.
Unimportant, T-Bug. Please focus. Need your help - got no clue what I'm supposed to look for once I'm in.
Got it. You ready?
Fire 'er up, Judy.
Evelyn… She… I felt her fear.
Sure got it under control quick, too.
So - chip's gotta stay in the freezer?
Yorinabu's got the case here, guaranteed.
You skilled enough to kill it all?
Can you shut 'em off?
Can't get around them ourselves?
Yep, that'll do. Thanks Judy. We got it. Later, T-Bug.
And it keeps you outta harm's way. Clever.
We needed that recording, Judy. The BD practically does our job for us.
Think I see how you know so much about Yorinobu.
So it's just about the sex?
You're sure Yorinobu doesn't expect this kinda move from you?
You're not worried? Arasaka will flag and screen anyone who's had dealings with Yorinobu.
Intel on Yorinobu, the chip, the BD from Konpeki… Winds are right, plan's perfect. A job like this comes one in a million.
Just sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?
I wanna know if you're really in control here. That you're not sending me into the sorta shit I can't wade out of.
Go, what now?
You wanna fuck over our fixer. I knew something was up.
Evelyn, you don't mess with fixers. That's the one rule every merc in this city knows - and actually follows.
Doesn't matter. Mistake like that'll cost you your rep. And without a rep, you're nobody. You sure you wanna do this?
If I agree, there'll be hell to pay. For sure.
I'll be finished. Dex won't forgive a dirt move like this.
Huh, lemme think about it.
OK.
Turns out Evelyn's recording from Konpeki was worth our time.
Nothin' yet. On it now.
Know more than your number. Heard you misplaced a convoy.
Nuh-uh, not on the horn. Let's meet, cut a deal.
Got an offer for ya.
Calm the fuck down! I just wanna talk!
Yep. Just little ol' me.
That guy? Never seen him before.
Listen, I know where the transport is. I can help you. Just want a favor in return.
Couldn'ta been chill from the start?
I need a bot - Flathead model. Guys who ripped you off have it. Promise me that bot, I'll point the finger.
Could just take it by force. But they're expecting payment, so I could go that route, too.
Sounds solid enough. I'm in.
Been waitin' long?
T-Bug show any sign of life? You two talk?
So, Dex already paid the Maelstromers for the corpo bot. Thing is, can't be sure the gangoons are still willin' to hand it over.
Doubt shit can go smoothly. This is Maelstrom.
Gimme a minute.
Let's go see these bastards.
Just a gang like any other, right?
Just open the fuckin' door.
Wanna talk to Royce. Dex sent us.
Don't think I've ever seen security like this in a chow factory.
Anti-personnel mine, directional Shrapnel spitter. My favorite…
Here to see Royce. We got biz to transact.
You got a bot - model MT0D12, called the Flathead.
Guy I represent already paid Brick for it. I'm just here for the pick-up. I can talk direct to Royce, if necessary.
Jesus, Jack. What gives?
Jack, sit down.
Whatcha blowin'?
Black Lace? Tough to get your hands on. Gotta have a good source.
Ups 'dorphs and adrenaline to the point you feel no pain. Trip's so intense it verges on psychosis. Corps fed it to their fighting legions during the Corp Wars.
Militech's not gonna come lookin' for it?
Need to see it.
Mhm, could lose your lunch.
Huh, Raven's not the dedicated control unit for a Flathead.
It'll have to do.
Brick got it. It's all paid up.
Fuck Brick, then. Let's cut a new deal.
Relax. Got 'em right here.
Want it or not? I got places to be.
Dexter DeShawn, that's who.
Got the set - bot and controller.
It's a production line. Plus, I thought you loved meat.
Detonator, armed.
Been in here a while?
Guess it's kinda your fault we're here. Came for some tech Dex bought.
Lookin' a little like we mighta saved your skin.
Sure you'll manage all right?
What happened to Stout?
And you? Why're you here?
Yeah, I doubt that… Pretty tough to get corpses to talk.
We make a good team, Jack.
In any case, I don't regret switchin' my life up the way I did.
Got the bot.
Sure. 'Course there was trouble. Royce couldn't've given two shits that you and Brick had shaken on it.
Met with Stout. Managed to strike a deal.
Gave me the chip with the scratch for Maelstrom.
No. Decided I could use the eddies myself. And I just grabbed the bot.
Not just. Had to use violence.
We're all set, ready to go. What now?
Great, be there in no time.
What's new with Señora Welles?
We have arrived - the major leagues.
Really, Jackie?
Told you that myself.
We're friends of Dexter DeShawn. He's expectin' us.
Hey.
Looks like we're up.
Thought Dex was the best.
You order.
Looks like the dog ate mine…
How long's the Afterlife been around? Half a century?
Gotta be the oldest club in Night City.
Say I wanted a drink named after me - what would I have to do?
To Night City!
Who else can I drink here?
Guess dyin's a small price to pay for goin' down in history.
Dex a regular? He come here a lot?
How'd you know?
Thanks.
Thanks for your help back at the scav haunt.
Couldn't've gone better. In fact, she liked me so much, she made me another offer.
Mhm. Kind where we ditch the middleman and split the pot an even fifty-fifty.
Appreciation don't convert to eddies, and Evelyn offered us a bunch.
Thought you'd be pissed, that you'd lose it.
How 'bout we go over the plan? Whatcha got for us, Dex?
Well, here goes nothin'.
Transport's a Delamain?
Which is…
These new identities - tell us more. What's our cover?
How do we get in the penthouse?
OK, feel brought up to speed.
That's more like it, Dex.
Thanks, T.
And whadda we do while waitin'? Sit around, suck air?
Plan - what's your take?
Promise to send me a postcard?
You an' Dex known each other a while?
I'm good, no questions.
Somethin' I gotta take care of first.
Could definitely go for a drink.
Like any other.
Yep - on his way, catchin' up.
What's got you so antsy?
This combat mode even… legal?
Excelsior - what else is included?
Dex ain't skimpin', is he.
You're welcome.
Wouldn't get overly excited.
Haven't gotten there - not yet. Dunno, Jack… kinda feels like you're losin' that steel grip of yours.
We're not on our way to some party, Jack. We're about to pull a major heist. At Arasaka.
We'll be, uh, pullin' up to the hotel soon.
I want more Aristotle!
We're out front, Bug.
We're arms dealers.
We'd like to check in.
That's the one.
That won't be necessary. We'll go freshen up first, notify him ourselves.
Ugh, a nightmare…
Thank you.
Hmm?
Wouldn't hurt to take a peek inside…
What's gonna slap everyone?
Big deal.
Evenin’.
I'm good, thanks.
Hey.
Let's see whatcha got.
We're in our room.
Sounds simple enough.
Where's the shaft?
Flathead prepped to go?
Got a winner.
Surveillance cover the whole hotel?
Guests don't care?
Why me? Why do I gotta slot it in?
Here goes.
OK, got a clear view.
OK, Flathead's in.
Uhhh, Bug? Got a hitch.
Housekeeping's in my way.
All right, on it. Terrarium's got a control panel.
Got a smartroom panel. Useful?
Terrarium's got a temp and air quality controller.
Hey, Bug! It worked!
‘Kay…
Looks like he's havin' trouble.
Want me to enable?
OK, he's at it.
Dweller's inside.
Still weird the hotel's only got one 'runner.
Flathead oughta be able to neutralize him.
Make it sound like I'm new at this.
Let's figure it out.
Mighta found our way in!
Fine. Little dizzy, that's all.
You there, Bug?
Hmm? Who gave what up?
Ehh fuck 'im! Why do I need to care about some bougie prick and his street-kid fantasies?
Got bored of bein' rich, an' then got bored of playin' tough.
What now?
On it. Your turn, Bug.
Preem!
Good. Let's go!
Where?!
We're in.
Bodyguard?
We wait…
Bug, who we got incoming?
Shush. Doubt this cubby's soundproof.
Sshh.
Too close. If he'd sniffed us out…
Yorinobu… just offed Saburo!
Bug, need you to get us out of here. Now!
Fuck…!
Bug!
Fuck! Fuckin' major leagues! Happy now, Jackie?!
If they're here for Saburo, they're a little late!
Oof… Close one…
How's the biochip…?
An' tell her we fried the case?!
Got a problem! Cryocase is damaged. Biochip's integrity at… Jackie?
Eighty-six percent and droppin'!
What the hell are you talkin' about?
Jackie…? You OK?
We're workin' on it!
Got it.
Shard gives us access to the door.
What?
Think all this is funny?!
Your liver could be fucked!
Tell Bug, why don'tcha. Maybe she'd still be alive if we hadn't been so gung-fuckin'-ho!
Delamain, gun it!
We'll have problems if you don't fuckin' DRIVE!
Not bad!
How's our ride lookin'?
Delamain…!
Calm?!
Leave it to me!
Phew!
You're white as a ghost, Jack…
Take us to a ripperdoc! Now!
Fuck your liberty! Do what I say!
It's gonna be all right! You'll see Misty, your mom… everyone you love. Jackie! Don't close your eyes!
W-what?
Just… gimme a sec, will ya?!
Nowhere. Stay here and don't move. I'll be right back.
See ya in the major leagues, Jack.
Lemme in.
Don't care to know how Jackie is?
Bled out in the back seat. Dead.
Got it right here.
What?!
You're the one who got us into this mess! Let's start with your prep work? You had no idea Saburo Arasaka'd be at the hotel?
That wasn't us!
I’ll fucking kill you!
Help me…
Argh! Fuck…
Fuck… Uuugh!
You… you were at Konpeki Plaza…
I know… someone…
Did well back there…
Viktor… will fix us up.
Why… why not just cut me loose? I'm dead weight to you.
All right, all right…
Just come… pick me up… Need to get to Misty's Esoterica… front of Vik's…
Ugh… my head.
Fuck…
Dunno, Vik… ears're ringin'. And I'm seein' shit…
Blinding lights. It's loud. I'm on stage and almost can't breathe. I'm so damn full of… hatred. Then I let it all out into a mic. And I realize it didn't help, I don't feel any better. And then, promise not to laugh. I plant a bomb in Arasaka Tower.
They killed me, Vik.  Never been so afraid.
Night City looked different… strange. And I hated it. Hated everybody, every inch.
It was too real, even for a lucid dream.
Sayin' I experienced another psyche's memories? How's that possible?
Two? Me and who, Vik, who's the other?
Hang on, mean to say there's an actual terrorist in my head - right now?
What is?
Never given me that look before, Vik. What is it?
Say what now?
Think you can top the terrorist in my brain?
You'll fix me up, right? Vik?

You're the best of the best, Vik. Why can't you help me?
I have to die, I am going to die — that what you're saying? Prove it.
Empty vessel? But I'm right here - all of this is me!
Don't omit a thing, not one dete.
Bullet in the head from Dexter DeShawn. But, how do you come back from something like that?
People don't just die and then get up like nothing happened.
What about me, my psyche? I make it back from the other side, and what? I'm supposed to pretend change is normal?
So this fucking terrorist wants to wipe me and take my place, take my body.
Can't we just take the chip out? Or switch it off?
Fuck, I remember this thing, saw it on TV… What was that stupid slogan? Soul something?
That's it! It's just supposed to let you communicate with constructs.
Vik, you've always come through for me. If there's nothing you can do to help me, then… well, what the hell do I do? Tell me, please. Vik?
And then he died… and I thought I was gonna die… with him, in my sleep.
Can't actually tell if I'm awake now. I mean, I could be dead already, right?
Givin' me a pill to prod that sonofabitch? So he can kill me faster?
The brain can be tricked. Plain old painkillers do that.
The fuck I need pills for? Oughta just stick a gun in my mouth, pull the trigger.
Gotta lie down…
Didn't you hear? My condition's terminal. What good can this do?
Really think I can make it, survive this?
Misty, wait. Umm… about Jackie…
Misty, wait. Umm… about Jackie… I'm so fucking sorry Jack's not here anymore.
Sure you'll be all right?
Where'd you even come from? How're we even talking?
Fuckin' ghost off!
Fuck!
No! Wait! Ugh…
See you never, asshole.
I'm… gonna kill you.
Ugh. Fuck me…
Why'd you help me, anyway?
This about the biochip? That why I'm here?
Huh. Vik likes to talk, I guess…
What's it you actually want from me?
Evelyn… what's she to you?
Been thinkin' oughta have a word with her myself. She promised to help me get rid of the chip.
Just answered your own question 'bout where Evelyn is - long gone.
Why you figure she skipped town?
You ask a looot of questions.
Might be your turn now to say something interesting.
. Got no clue. [same as the next dialogue option]
Suspect so, yeah.
Evelyn was knowledgeable about the relic, had a large chunk of classified info. An enigma, to be sure, but she showed that slyness you get in corpo agents... you know the kind.
You got tossed out, lumped with the outcasts, easily. Or have you forgotten?
Don't think so, no.
Don't matter how much perfume a corpoy sprays on mornings, by lunch that's replaced with the stench of skullduggery. Only thing I caught from Evelyn was determination.
Nope. You're startin' to stink, period.
Sorry I couldn't be of any help. Don't have any time to lose, so…
Is that all? Really should be goin'.
Pff. Lookin' for justice? In Night City?
And you think they'll trust the word of a merc?
What if I say no?
So what we stroll into Arasaka HQ and announce that Yorinobu's a kinkiller? That he murdered Saburo?
A lie-detector? Forget it.
Exactly what kind of people are we talkin' about?
Ya mean people like Anders Hellman?
Prepped for the heist, thoroughly. Relic is Hellman's design, his creation.
Let it go, Takemura.

Tom's all right. Not afraid to speak his mind, that's all.
Last thing we wanna do is to draw attention.
Thanks for the offer. Need to think about it, get back to you.
Leave? Why would I leave? Need help, best chance I'll find the right person here.
Actually, we just talked about some.
With a bit of luck, I'll track down Evelyn.
Honor among thieves - ever heard of it?
Yorinobu Arasaka'd agree, I'm sure.
Anders Hellman - he invented the Relic. If I wanna get rid of it, he's my man. And if that means picking another fight with Arasaka, so be it.
Somebody's been busy the last few days.
Your job, basically.
Defected? Where to? Some other corp poach him?
Why're you looking for Hellman?
Corpo rats'll squeal when hangin' by their tails.
She take you for a suit?
Mean to say you worked for Saburo yet got no idea how to talk to the high and mighty?
Rogue's well informed, gets wind of most things that happen in the city. Might be worth asking her about Hellman.
Till then, I guess.
You know you got some nerve. First you’re out to kill me, now you wanna be my pal? Make like nothing happened?
What do you want?!
Go fuck yourself, dickwipe!
Why should I trust you? Remind me again.
You're the ghost of Christmas past, asshole. Any Friends you had're either dead or so old their memory's gone.
So you fuckin' know Rogue. What do I say to her? Got a talking brain tumor claims it's her old friend Johnny?
Don't need convincin'. Seen your memories. Gross.
There is no "us."
How're you doin'?
Callin' to offer my condolences.
Say no more, Mama Welles. I'll be there.
Wouldn't mind one.
Been better, to tell you the truth.
That night, when Jackie fell… Let's just say things haven't exactly been easy since.
An ofrenda? Wh-what's that, exactly?
Sure some beer'd be at the top of Jackie's list.
Could help you with that.
Wanna take part in the ceremony, but… wanna do it the right way - in line with tradition.
But something I'd lay by his casket… That'd do justice to his memory, I-I don't got anything…
Jackie had a garage?
You won't mind me digging through his stuff?
Thanks, Mama Welles.
You here alone? This is not exactly the safest neighborhood in town, Misty.
What're you doin' here?
Hardly gonk at all… just, well, human.
You know each other long?
Till a year back.
Jack talked about you a lot. Always sayin' how much you meant to ‘im.
Heh, maybe, but that's what he meant. I really believe that.
What'd you see in him?
Spoken like a true Heywood boy.
How come you're outside?
Jackie never gave you a set? Who you two didn't get that far?
Mama Welles is having a send-off for Jackie. I need to find somethin' he really cared about. Ya mind givin' me a hand?
Still too soon?
Jackie'd want you here - that's more important. Come on.
Jackie loved to pump iron, didn't he?
Gotta be hanging here since 2020.
A fine piece o' metal and mechanics. Heh. He was so psyched…
Loved to poke around engines.
Knowing him, it's a miracle he never wiped out.
"For Whom the Bell Tolls" - Ernest Hemingway.
Have you read it? Is it any good?
It'd be a good tribute for the ofrenda, though.
Guess no man cave's complete without some of those, huh?
That's definitely why they're up there, yeah.
Still full.
How come?
Basketball signed by Dante González.
Like Jackie?
That a… mandala…?
Hey, you all right?
I guess you made a bigger impression than you thought.
It's beautiful.
An aquarium?
And Taco was…
Sounds like a mighty expensive fish.
Jackie's favorite tequila. Huh, still sealed.
Who--the founder of Centzon Tequila?
Wha… how'd Jackie get this one?
Nice still. It's gotta be Jackie's dad.
D'you meet him?
Leather belt?
Why'd he hold onto it?
Takin' this, yeah. Perfect for Jackie.
Better get goin'.
What happened between you two, what's the beef?
What'd she have against you?
Right. You gotta come, Misty - you got a right to be there.
You were family to 'im.
You ever thought you might leave Night City?
Seriously? Meanin'?
I, uh… often think back to the first time me and Jack met. It all started when he put a heater to my head. Then some badges showed up. Beat the shit out of us both - it's half my fault, half his. And we hightailed it out together. Half an hour later… well, we're eatin' dinner at Mama Welles'. Turned out to have more in common than we thought - principles. Jackie Welles. Best friend you could ask for, loyal to a fault. Once he set his mind on something, he was ready to die to achieve it. He once told me, "Bróder, the one thing we can't do is be afraid of others." He kept Heywood in his heart, always. It made him who he was. But most importantly… Jackie loved life and had no fear. Heart on his sleeve, he didn't overthink things. He just went for it. Thought he was bulletproof and… and that he'd become legend at the Afterlife. And ultimately, he did what he set out to do - shit in the shoes of some powerful people. And if he's watching, I bet just about now he's flippin' 'em all the bird.
He always wanted more than he got outta life. Rest easy, choom.
I see the Valentinos haven't forgotten about Jackie.
Weird bein’ here without Jackie.
Pour. For Jackie.
I'll have another.
I'm gonna miss him. Already do.
Jackie Welles.
Well, uh, I should mingle, Vik.
How'd you meet Jackie?
In the Valentinos?
Think we might know each other.
V.
Thank you. All right, why not.
Good for now, thanks.
Hey. Are you all right?
You, uh, here to say goodbye to one of your own, Padre?
Jackie, uh - did ya know him well?
So, Padre. You think Jackie's looking down upon us… from up there?
How're things in the streets?
I'm gonna move on.
Her name is Misty.
Misty. And she was very important to him. Do you understand? Go, invite her along for dinner. It's the least she deserves.
You… you sure? Jackie'd kill me if I got so much as a scratch on it.
Thank you. I'll take such good care of it.
You're not alone in thinking me dead… Thought it was game over for me, too.
Heard about the heist, I take it. Must've talked to Evelyn.
Listen, need to find Evelyn.
Know where she is?
Judy, you're my one hope, the only lead I got. I got to find her. An' I know you can help me do that.
Can we meet? Let's meet, please? You at Lizzie's?
Looking for Evelyn Parker. Know where I might find her?
Need to talk to Punchin' Judy. She in her den?
What was that all about?
Susie seems to know what she wants. She your boss?
Listen, have you seen Evelyn? Need to talk to her. It's important.
Need to find out who she was working for.
That's it. Judy, you don't need to worry - I won't lay a hand on her. Wouldn't make sense.
Megatower? Luxurious.
Give you a call, OK?
You're on engram in a fading mind. Nothing should surprise you anymore.
Why the hell not.
Name's V. And what, no “pleased to meet yous”?
Wakako Okada - the lady of Westbrook estate.
What’ve I missed this time? Enlighten me.
Arasaka and the Tyger Claws are in bed together. Go figure…
No. I mean, if Evelyn wanted to disappear, especially from Arasaka, she could've done better.
Someone's in a great mood.
Think Judy's lying? Why?
Oh, so what you meant to say was you're full of shit. Got it.
Looking for an Evelyn Parker. She work here?
Need to see her. It's important.
I'm not a customer.
Meaning?
How could you possibly know what I'm looking for?
So how's this all work?
So there'll be no trace of the meeting?
You're saying it's not dangerous, but there's some risk involved.
Consider my interest piqued. All right, let's do this.
Samurai.
Is that normal or…?
Rather go with Skye.
Not here to pay and play. Just want some info.
All right, I changed my mind. I'll pay.
There you go.
That it?
Go eat a dick, Johnny.
Would've had more choices if I didn't have a certain brain parasite.
V. Just V. Only people who know me real well can use my real name.
Welp, looks like this'll be interesting…
How'd you know I'm dying?
So what if I do? Why do you care?
There's something in those mirrors, way back…
Just what I needed - therapy with a robohooker.
Lookin' for someone named Evelyn Parker, used to work here. Know her? Know where she is?
Asked you a simple question.
You just gonna talk in circles, that it?
What's next? Meditation?
Just answer my question. Tell me where Evelyn is. Don't have time for a.. debate. Why'd the manager say she doesn't work here anymore? When was Evelyn last here? You know anything?
I was told this place'd fulfill my deepest desires. Not what I was expecting, this.
So what's it I need so badly?
That's tough. Rather let it eat away at me a bit more.
Still wanna be the best… Never gave up on that goal. Chances of getting there're starting to look pretty slim, though. Just want the world to know I was here. That I mattered.
Death is death is death. You're gone - game over.
Believe me, I've seen it. And it's fucking boring.
What I've been through - tough to move on from that. Death was something that happened to other people - hell, that I DEALT to others. Now my number'll be up. Wasn't enough. I died once. Have to go and do it again.
So what now?
Which is? You're gonna tell me?
But how do I keep up with everything that's changing…?
Thanks, um… for all this. Jeez. Don't even feel like getting up…
Samurai.
Need to talk to you.
Lotta things been going on in my head lately. But this was… different. Refreshing.
I get why people come here, come back… but I need something else. Evelyn Parker. What do you know about her?
You gotta help me. Please… I'm no threat. But she could be in trouble. Just wanna talk to her, find out if she's OK.
Anything out of the ordinary happen here lately?
A customer attacked her?
Where'd it happen?
Gonna just stand there or tell me a number?
This booth occupied now?
Need to get inside that booth somehow.
None of your biz. Can you open it or not?
Who's Tom?
Where'll I find him?
Thanks. See? You turned out to be useful after all.
Blood - fresh, not too much. Put it to a wound rather than a kill.
Sounds crazy, but… she could've been remotely hacked. A netrunner?
Looks familiar.
Evelyn's jacket. Crumpled like a tissue - must've been here a while.
Relax, ya don't need any data, don't need any detes, I'm not a customer. Here to talk to you specifically. Not to be with a doll. Tom. Is that it?
Need to get in touch with Evelyn Parker. It's important.
Mean to say she's not here?
Which was it - Osaka or Oslo?
That accident. Involved a client, did it? Found blood in her booth.
And everyone's cool with that?
Tell you herself she was skippin' town?
Where can I find this Woodman?
Woodman - who is he?
OK, Mr. Forrest then. What's his thing?
Got it.
Looking for a girl named Evelyn Parker.
But she used to. What happened to her?
Look to me like a reasonable man. I think we can work something out.
You've got info, I've got eddies. It's a fair trade. What's your price?
Oh well… Can't say I didn't try playing nice.
Doll goes missing client gets messed up, and management's just sitting there, sucking his thumb… Pretty strange for a place that advertises itself as one hundred per cent secure.
I can see it already - headline in tomorrow's screamsheets. Got all the evidence I need, too…
You're not helping. Now what…
That just might work.
Chip was busted… Could've sent her to get it patched up.
Left her purse.
All her shit's in it, though. Must've left in a hurry.
Don't have time to massage egos.
Course you do, you'd've loved to drop an H-bomb on this place.
Think Fingers's got her? Think we'll find her there?
Gah, fuck!
Jesus… the fuck do you want from me?
Lemme alone.
Wanted me dead, said so yourself.
Can't find the words to describe exactly how fucked up you are.
To live life to the fullest? See the northern lights, run with the mechbulls or with gazelles on a safari?
But why? Fightin' for some dated ideal? Pursuin' a personal vendetta?
You know you're just an irritating hallucination, right? Should just ignore you.
You fuckin' asshole…
OK, so, this Mikoshi - what is it, exactly?
Yeah, seen the memories - did a real number on ya.
Sure. That's how you became a construct.
Still don't see how Mikoshi's linked to my chip problem.
And, uh, how you plan to smash Arasaka this time? Got another nuke tucked away?
I'm s'posed to know who that is?
Jack, I got no clue where you are, happened to you… It all got so fucked up. If you… If you're there somewhere… Fuck, I… What'm I doing?
Promised I'd call, didn't I?
Evelyn's not at Clouds anymore.
Behavioral chip was damaged. 'Parently they carted her off to a ripperdoc goes by Fingers.
Know where to find this Fingers character?
Headin' there now. To find her.
So, this more up your alley than Clouds?
Got a message for Fingers. Comes from the Tyger Claws.
Two things - urgent and confidential.
Meaning you've got a choice.
You either get your shit kicked in for being slow or for being a nosy prick.
Blue butter…? Hell are they taking?
Who can blame 'em, then. Hey, you all right?
Fingers - know where I can find him?
Fingers guy - you know 'im?
Like…?
Glad to see a familiar face.
We'll find her, I know we will. After the heist, Evelyn holed up with the Mox for a while, right?
So why the hell’d she go back to Clouds?
Mox don't happen to have Fingers in their crosshairs?
Heard joytoys come out of his clinic in worse shape then they come in.
Why me?
Think Evelyn's being kept here somewhere?
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
Moment you knew where she was, you sprang into action.
You worked at Clouds?
Fingers - where'll find him?
My friend here? She's in really sorry shape. Couldn't let us cut in front, just this once?
She's a toughie. Keeps it inside, mostly. C'mon let's go.
Looking for a girl named Evelyn Parker. I know she was here in your… clinic.
Where is she?
These girls know you're chippin' faulty implants?
Heard you help the workin' girls around here.
Already told you. I'm lookin' for a woman named Evelyn Parker. Need to know where she is.
Wen jittery soon as I mentioned her name. Don't try gettin' out of this. I know you remember her.
Mox've got a low tolerance for scum like you. Right now, I'm the one thing standing between you and a particularly feisty and furious member of the gang. So tell me where Evelyn is or I'll let her to talk to you.
Mentioned you couldn't help her. Help her with what exactly?
Damage was caused by a netrunner using homebrewed malware.
Get to the point.
Don't talk to her like that.
Look, the quicker you spill, the shorter you'll have to put up with us. Now, Evelyn Parker. Where is she?
What do you mean by "underground"?
You're sure about this?
Where'll we find her?
Who'd you call? Who's your fixer?
Where'd they take her?
These guys, what'd they look like?
Really now? They looked like you…?
The two that came for her… didn't say anything about where they were gonna take her, what they were gonna do to her?
Don't worry, we'll find her. I know it.
Hey! Keep it together! Wanna give up, now?
We also know we're lookin' for something related to the Death's Head. Better than nothing.
Death's Head symbol bring anything to mind? Anything, doesn't matter how small.
Yeah, that'd make sense.
Loud and clear, you don't need to yell. What's up?
I didn't think big parties were your thing.
Could try sellin' iron straight from factory, skip the whole part where your tinker for hours on each little shooter.
Sure, I'm in. When?
Need to figure out where they're scrollin' this stuff. Gotta be a rot-hole of some sort, doubt they do much shooting on location.
Could be we'd see something to point us in their direction in one of their virtus.
Everyone, everything leaves something behind, just need to know where to look. Lucky for me, I'm runnin' around with the best BD specialist in town. That's an extra pair of expert eyes.
Lemme think for a sec. Dark net domain, that's our best bet. Let's stick to the plan.
OK, let's see, show me.
Can't believe she finds the spares to keep 'em runnin'.
Show me the range.
Lookin' for somethin' special. A braindance to really…
Nah. More hardcore.
Got anything that might interest me?
What've you got?
Any special kind?
Lookin' for BDs. A particular kind.
Cops are like kids - mommy and daddy wouldn't let 'em go off on their lonesome.
Gimme the best of the best. Ones with the Death's Head.
How 'bout a discount for your newest customer?
I'm no connoisseur, trust me.
All I need to know is who makes 'em… and where.
Where do you get these scrolls?
Just curious, that's all.
Got anything that might interest me?
Ready when you are.
Can't beat that rich synthcoff aroma - cheap shit. Cold, too. Mmmhm. Buck-A-Slice. Scav woman. Huh, who knew that 'sides citoppin' people up they were scrollin' XBD… Poor fucker. Electric Corp patch on the coveralls. Scav - gotta be. No one else with that kind of fashion sense. Ordered recently. Coffee was cold… like, from the day before. Pizza looked fresh, though.
Means someone's grabbing Buck-A-Slice regularly. Which is not something one does for the flavor and fresh ingredients. Pizza shares its DNA with styrofoam, nobody's gonna schlep across town for it. OK, we're lookin' for an Electric Corp power plant located near a Buck-A-Slice.
Radio's turned way up. Probably to drown out the screamin'. Heard shit like that before. Sounds like scavs to me. Here we go. Old Electric Corp power plant in Charter Hill. Gotta make do with that for now. Nothin' else to garner from this scroll.
No time to lose. We gotta go there.
Let's get going.
Still can't shake it… that virtu sample we sow, with the Death's Head moth… If all they scroll is snuff, then…
What do you mean?
We goin' in?
It's not gonna be pretty in there.
All right. Goin' in.
I'm here. Got no time to creep around.
Found a way down. You see my position?
Evelyn's?
Smells like propylmethionine. Must be cookin' RPM here.
OK.
I can always just get rid of 'em my way.
‘Cept these are solid steel, not the softcore, plastic kind. Even if you come here on your own, gunnin' to become a star, there's no guarantee you're ever gettin' out.
Gutted out all her implants. And why stop there? Took a few internal organs while they were at it.
Scavs… No matter how many you stomp out, there'll always be more crawlin' around somewhere.
'Fraid so.
Close to the studio, I think. You find anything useful?
What do you think? What do I do now?
Johnny, she's unconscious.
All right. Let's do this.
Now!
What's wrong with her?
She OK to be moved? No brain hemorrhages, damage to the spine?
Umm… hey, Evelyn. I need you to tell me who hired you.
Let's get her somewhere safe.
Which way?
Elevators it is, then.
Fine, have it your way. Smoke to your lungs' content.
Let's give 'em a couple. You saw how she looked.
It's not up to you, though, is it? Let's go.
Ugh…
I need to talk to her.
How's she feeling?
You're mad at her? Why?
Judy, I didn't have any other…
So I don't get why….
How many BDs did you manage to rip?
Guessin' you saw them already?
OK, show me.
Hey. How ya feelin'? Need anything? Not here to nag. Just talk. I know it's a bad time, but I gotta ask. You got any idea how to remove the biochip..? Or know anyone else who might? Listen, Evelyn. I really need your help. It's important. If I don't do anything, and do it soon, I'll die.
All right, roll it.
Mhm. Glad you managed to salvage 'em in the first place.
Can't see her face.
That or someone's working it for her.
Hmm… think I recognize these.
Veve markings.
Not enough to know what they actually mean. Heard of who might use 'em, though.
Could be the Voodoo Boys… But that's just a hunch. Can't be a hundred percent sure.
Maybe… but all of them are from Pacifica. Narrows down our search at least.
Looks like I'm goin' on a field trip to Pacifica. All right, think we got everything.
Woman who hired Evelyn… any idea who we're up against?
Now we know what happened at Clouds. They're the ones who tried to flatline her. Launched a nuke at her chip.
She knew more than they thought she know. Couldn't let that go.
Looks like Evelyn never told us the whole truth.
Her only job was to record a virtu. Pretty damn amazing she managed to organize a full-blown heist. And swipe the biochip from under her boss' noses.
Sure, why not. Nothing that can surprise me at this point.
Dunno… Haitian Creole? It is the Voodoo Boys…
We have to know what they're saying. Could be important.
OK, Judy. We're good.
Biochip we stole…? It's got Silverhand's engram burned onto it.
Digitized psyche, personality construct.
Can you… can you give me a minute? Need to go over some stuff. In my head.
Know who they are - who the woman is? Any idea how we find them?
These people - what could they want from Alt?
Got no notion whatsoever?
Thought you said nothing could help us?
Why? Worried that I'll give Evelyn up to them?
So why the worried look?
I'll ask around, make a few calls… Lemme put it this way. The Voodoo Boys wouldn't trust a cat if it walked onto their turf… But someone's gotta know a way in.
See ya around, Judy.
Ugh… How's biz going?
Good thing you got Misty here to help. Handles your griping well.
know what? Seems like you're the only person in Night City who's happy with his lot.
Got a few questions about Silverhand and this chip.
How's it even possible? Seein' him?
Tried to flatline me, Johnny did.
What can I do suppress him? Y'know, avoid my murder?
And what then?
Why'm I relivin' Johnny's memories?
Finally scrounged up enough eddies to pay you back in full.
I'm not takin' 'em all the way to my grave, Vik. Here. And thanks again for doing so much work on me 'thout ever seein' an enny.
Was thinkin' about swappin' some chrome. Got any new toys?
Wakako. Long time, no see.
Willing to bet nobody knows Westbrook like you do.
What did they do?
Can't help asking - how many of those husbands did you have?
Not afraid that tragedy will strike you?
We have some outstanding biz to settle. Remember Sandra Dorsett?
How's biz treatin' ya, Cassius?
Let's see what's good.
Oh fuck…!
Stop talking.
Checked her pulse?
How'd this happen?
Fwoo… fuck.
Don't blame yourself, won't solve anything.
Stop, couldn't watch her twenty-four seven… She'd made up her mind. Would've found a way. Always. Gotta do somethin' with her.
Not sure we should move her before the bodges get here.
Y'know… to you she was your best friend, so it's a terrible tragedy. But… they must get dozens of calls like this every day.
No, just sayin'.
Didn't know you smoked.
Heh, here.
Wanna hold on to it?
Can't wrap my head around it… I never saw Evelyn as the type to give up…
Mhm… did say so.
Wait, so you found other recordings?
Then why was it saved as a virtu?
What'd Woodman do to her? Did you see it?
I zeroed Woodman. Didn't plan on it - just how the chips landed. Glad I did, though.
Like what?
Sure you don't need anything?
Anything comes up, holler on the holo.
What's important?
Old friend, well-connected to the influential… why so mysterious? Get to the point.
That's gonna help us how, exactly?
Of all people, you oughta know Night City tests everyone's reliability - even that of "old friends." Sure about this guy? Trust him?
Fine. Where's the meet and when?
Seems pretty, uh, secluded here.
What the hell happened? Look close to awful.
Friend you mentioned here?
Willing finally to give me the spec on 'im?
Hanako Arasaka's? From the carrier at anchor in the bay? Saburo's daughter?
And what's to stop her little errand boy from selling us out?
Right, 'cause Arasaka's ranks're chock-full of those.
Sure you can trust him?
Pff. Convincing, very.
Worse. 'Cause I got plenty to lose.
Just hope he doesn't blindly follow Arasaka protocol.
Unwritten rules. Had 'em here in Night City. Could be different in Japan. If I got even a whiff of treason, they'd prep an enhanced interrogator and send two elite squads with air support to grab the suspect.
Hm. That supposed to be reassuring?
Can speak for myself, you know.
Was there. Saw what happened. Yorinobu strangled the old guy.
Not gonna like what I'm about to say. I need a guarantee I'm safe here…
All right, then. Konpeki Plaza - I was there the night it happened. Looked like your typical family quarrel, until… Yorinobu lunged at Saburo an' started chokin' him…
But you can't ignore the truth!
Sorry, but… this gonna take much longer?
Wanna help or not?
We're talkin' about a guy who killed his father to seize control of Arasaka! Gonna take an interest in this or not?
Oda. It's not as if we're asking for a whole lot, here. Just one brief meeting. Hanako should decide if what we say is true. You can't decide for her. Will you help?
Oda, you are an Arasaka soldier! This is not a request. We remind you of your duty to be truthful to your superiors.
Wasn't always what I am now. And your friend here didn't always look like a bum. Feel free to join us. Plenty of room at the bottom of the heap. Not enticed? Then do your duty. Tell Hanako what nobody else wants to hear.
Just gotta tell it like it is sometimes.
How come?
Fine friend, there. Got any more?
No way this was gonna work.
Well… can't say we didn't try.
Hm, how do you figure that?
Hold on…
Er, hang on, not so fast! Make it sound as easy as hacking a SCSM. But you said yourself - Hanako's got the tightest security in all Night City.
Know just the fixer dame - Wakako Okada. Runs a pachinko parlor on Jig-Jig Street.
Get there on my own, thanks.
Sure, why not.
Just a Night City name.
Any idea what's going on at Arasaka?
You all right, Goro?
Have shared interests - you and I. Or have you forgotten?
Good. 'Cause catching lead in Night City's easier than catching a cold - and I need you alive.
Uh, just asking? Does everything with you have to have an ulterior motive?
Hideshi, don't leave this poor guy hangin'.
Wow...
Fine, let's go.
Hideshi Hino - the comedian.
Happen to be workin' together, that's all. — [to 2]
Eddies is why. Always about eddies, Wakako. You wanna make 'em - we got biz. Doesn't get any simpler.
Would've already made the call if you intended to. Simple - you're curious to see what we got.
Need Intel on the parade that's scheduled to come through Japantown.
Goro? Remind me why Dex's fat, backstabbing ass is currently indisposed?
Butchered and dumped at a landfill by some Arasaka goon. Real shame, that.
No threat, no. Asked why I couldn't reach Dex, I answered: Just facts, nothin' more.
Cm'on, got your finger on the 'hood's pulse, know everything.
Arasaka, Tyger Claws - kinda like the family dog screwin’ the cat, huh? Can't possibly be fond of the people who killed your grandkid.
Time's the best healer? Wound like that, though…
For free? You sure?
Not at all curious what we're going to all this trouble for?
Thanks, Wakako.
Stay safe, Goro.
Just… low profile, OK? Don't start handing out autographs.
What, she doesn't "charm" you anymore? Having doubts?
Let me know if I can be of help.
what, suddenly Wakako's not a "delightful mature woman"..?
Pretty quick on the dial - just got here.
What gave me away? It's the hair, isn't it.
Makin' sure I didn't get lost?
Couldn't meet somewhere else? Not big on funerals.
You my contact? Someone finally gonna tell me about this job?
Interesting biz strategy ya got in Pacifica. No details, no names. No one knows a thing.
You screenin' me? See if I came alone? What kinda chrome I got? This some kinda test?
Who died? Got somethin' to do with the job?
Wanna talk with Brigitte. She here somewhere?
Well, my creole's a bit rusty…
Shit luck, right? All those, an' I don't know yours…
You actually sell meat outta here? Really?
Lookin' for Placide.
Ughh… ngh.. fooo…
You Placide?
Wanna talk to your boss.
Y'know, I heard a few things about you.
Voodoo Boys… best runners in town. Least that's what they say. Though nobody really knows what you do on the Net.
I mean, bleedin'-edge black soft, corporate data heists, wagin' war on NetWatch… But no one mentions… chickens.
Here I thought selling poultry was illegal) Here I thought selling domesticated fowl was still illegal. Six years poultry's supposedly had the plague. Now all of a sudden - poof - it's clean?
Told me at the chapel you're the one to talk to.
Mr. Hands sent me. Said you got mercwork needs doin'.:
I wanna talk to Brigitte.
And you'll tell me more about the job?
Where we headed?
Nah. You guys aren't exactly great at rollin' out the welcome mat for outsiders.
But now?
What do you trade in, exactly?
Yeah. A few times. You want the Animals out of the GIM? Extinct? That why you hired me?
I mean, it makes no sense, them being here. Middle of Pacifica, no backup, cut off… It's your turf. Hell, even badges don't patrol around here.
They tryna provoke you? Make you do somethin' stupid?
How many we talkin' about in there?
When do I see Brigitte?
Could fuckin' tell me what you plan to do first.
Or you'll do what? You got a line of volunteers waitin'?
Dammit, here goes nothin'…
Got a feeling we're not gonna become best friends. No chemistry.
Evelyn Parker. Ring a bell?
She did work for you once.
Why not send your own goons to the GIM?
How's that been workin' out for ya?
You two know each other?
Oh, so now you're a ripperdog, too?
Is that at all relevant? Or just a cheap scare tactic?
Y'know what? Fuck this.
Besides that, everything's OK?
Any of that a dealbreaker?
Mah, unimportant. Busted anyway.
Chip's why I'm here, why I wanna word with Brigitte. Doesn't look at all familiar?
Got a bullet to the brain. Hasn't worked since. That's how.
You know, you haven't asked about my experience, what I can do….
Once inside, what do I do?
So... Am I right for the job, good to go?
Van's definitely a custom job.
Hey, just tryin' to piece the facts together.
You record all this on your own?
But from inside the GIM - squat, right?
Tech looks pretty advanced. Doesn't scream meathead to me.
Time for a break? Think you might be needed.
Animals aren't the play here, are they?
They're hired muscle. Someone else needed them. Someone with a van all of netrunner tech. And that's where I come in? To sniff out who?
Why? What for?
We know who the 'runner inside is? What he wants?
So, aim to keep an eye on me. Shows trust.
All right, anything else I should know?
My pay - how much we talkin, and how'm I gonna collect?
Uh-huh, ‘cept then I found out you need me to be a bullet trap on enemy turf. That means my fee's just gone up.
So I do this and you put me in front of Brigitte, right?
None too fond of strangers, here, are you?
Meanin’… I best watch it?
Brigitte even know we're supposed to meet? Or did you cook this deal up all by yourself?
So "Voodoo Boys" - why? Don't seem to believe in voodoo.
Mean to say you call yourselves something else? Aaand you ain't gonna tell me, are ya? Right.
All ears, what?
Mhm. Seems so.
They know you're watching 'em?
Know the way in? Was told you would.
Anything interesting happen over there?
No one in, no one out?
Just takin’ in the sights. OK. I'm in.
Right.
It even work? Said this place was abandoned years ago.
Wait, who was that?
So… he knows I'm here.
OK, van's in sight.
OK, at the van. But no sign of the 'runner.
While I got ya here, mind tellin' me what we're lookin' at?
Who is 'they'?
What're they lookin' for, exactly?
How bad's it look?
NetWatch who?
OK, so what's on me to do?
What? Placide, what?
Then what now?
Rather not pick a fight with the Watch if I don't have to.
OK, so what do I do once I find him?
Can't just scorch him via the Net? He's gotta be jacked into the van.
What's goin' on?
That bad, huh?
Placide — what's goin' on?
Think she's had enough.
Placide?
What'd you do?
Just a second ago you tried to flatline me. And now you wanna talk?
OK, no more fuckin' tangents. Fess up — who are you?
Sorry, don't work with corps.
Not interested. Not a money job for me, just need on in with Maman Brigitte, Voodoo chefin.
You have Brigitte? And how'd you manage that?
You're bluffing. Got your back against the wall, can't budge, no room to dodge the bullet.
Oh? Want what's best for me? Altruism now part of the NetWatch mission?
Rather put my trust in the Voes than in you, by a mile.
Voodoos know black tech better than anyone. So, no, think I prefer their expertise over yours.
Got anything to back that claim? That the Voodoos wanna set me up?
Asked for proof. 'Sides, I'd know.
Fine.  And…? Nothin' outta place, no trace of—
What's your beef with the Voodoos?
Want me to guess?
Brigitte and the other one, Neptune — What's their condition?
But.. they can't sustain that…
Little taste of your own medicine? The data collection — why would you target Pacifica's runners?
This's about Rezo Agwe, Isn't it? Can’t have an indie net where you aren't welcome to protect and serve, huh?
All right, what're you offerin'?
OK, do it.
Fan of westerns, huh?
Righteous sherrif - think you mighta found NetWatch's new recruiting slogan.
Ever seen "Unforgiven"? With the Hackman guy?
Give it a shot sometime. A must-watch.
Oh, Placide is gonna be pissed...
You guys know each other? 'Runner world's a small one, I guess.
Convo's going nowhere) Think I'll just stick to my plan.
Gimme a sec…
Thanks, wasn't asking… Ugh… what happened?
Then why's my brain not a pile of hot goo?
Not about to let this shit lie.
So, what? I shoulda spilled the truth?
Felt like those words came to you awfully easy.
Gee, thanks.
Brigitte and the other guy - are they back?
Perfect. 'Cause I gotta talk to her.
Taken care of.
I'll find him.
That the other guy you sent to the GIM? Didn't make it looks like. You let loose in the GIM? With… what, exactly? A-a virus? A vectored electromag impulse? Saw it before my own fuses popped — your guys shredding tags on the NetWatch agents in Mosley's grid.
Looks like you fucked up. What's Brigitte make of it all?
He gonna pull through?
That him? That the scopsucker you sent into the mechdragon's den first?
I wanna talk to Brigitte, your boss!

I fucking dare you.
Listen, I didn't turn coat, didn't pick a side. We made a deal, is all.
Did what you wanted, 'cept 'stead of gettin' my circuits acid-fried, I'm still breathin'. That so damn wrong?
You must be Brigitte. Hard woman to find.
You know about the biochip, don't you?
That why you're talkin' to me now? 'Cause you know I got the biochip?
Not 'cause I saved your frozen ass?
If I was any ordinary "ranyon," you'd have dealt with me already.
Mhmm. Just like you. Only I came out of there on my own.
How much you know from my scans?
You recognized the biochip 'cause you were lookin' for it.
Shoulda thought about that before you tried to kill me.
Heh, biochip's not for sale. And you're not rippin' It outta me. Thing was in shit shape already before I strolled into the GIM.
Not that bad. Problem is, no one I've talked to tan yank it out without risk of death. Seein' as you commissioned the things theft, figured you might know on way to help.
Access is all yours. Want this thing outta my head ASAP.
Meant nothin' but problems ever since Konpeki. Haven't found a single soul capable of gettin' this thing outta me without scramblin' my brain. You commissioned the heist, so I figured you must know somethin'. You've gotta.
Biochip's busted. That's why I'm here. Haven't found a single soul capable of gettin' this thing outta me without scramblin' my brain. You commissioned the heist, so I figured you must know somethin'. You've gotta.
Evelyn Parker — name ring a bell?
Listen, can you help me or not?
Seriously? Haven't done enough for you already?
'Cause if you fuck up you're left empty-handed? That it?
Don't think I'm that desperate yet.
Maybe I got other options I don't know about yet.
How do I know you won't screw me again?
Fine. I'll give you access.
Then after you.
You guys sure seem to love this place. But, honestly, you don't give off a strong religious vibe.
So how come Placide didn't know about the biochip? He didn't recognize it in the scans.
Where we going?
Ugh…
Never gave him a chance.
Nope.
This an old subway tunnel?
Guess all this means you got your own SynthTech interface.
How do I know I'll come back? Do I get some guarantee?
Under YOUR watch.
How's all this any different from plain old netrunning?
OK, hang on. I wanna know what you need Silverhand for first.
Alt Cunningham… heard of 'er.
From Johnny. Though granted, not much.
Tell her what?
Construct's active. Lets me and Johnny shoot the shit every now and then.
What, think I'm hallucinating? Found myself an imaginary friend?
Tell ya one thing - doesn't shake out well for the human.
What's your plan to contact Alt?
Whoa, what? You said nothin' 'bout breakin' through the Blackwall.
Oh, come on. Not the tub.
Johnny? Looks like you're the bait. You OK with that?
What exactly do you want from Alt? All of you?
The change?
The Blackwall - what is it, exactly? I mean, I know…
That would be your Saturday morning NetWatch propaganda.
Let's do this.  Ooooh…
Ooooh…
Ooooh… OK, wh-what now? J-Johnny?
Where are we?
This is it? Seriously?
It's… it's all so alive. So real.
Seein' somethin' more than I am?
So - what now?
Brigitte..?
Thompson - what happened to 'im?
Maybe 'cause you whooped his ass to make yourself feel better.
Never told me half that about Alt.
I dunno - that you were a couple, that she wrote Soulkiller, that she's dead?
How the hell's she supposed to help us now? As a ghost?
I saw the body.
Wow. Were you going for Dickwipe of the Year?
Alt. You always treat her like shit?
And I'm wondering why. I mean, you told her you two were nothin'. You told you cared about her as far as the end of your cock.
Just tryin' to wrap my head around it. You went to rescue her 'cause you actually cared about her? Felt you had unfinished biz? Or was it just another excuse to go at Arasaka?
It ever occur to you she might've been right?
Thought that was more your style?
Lookin' at it now, with twenty-twenty hindsight, nothin' occurs to you?
Cause you're planning a reunion. You wanna ask Alt for help And you're no solo act, Johnny. Could've told me earlier, about Alt.
Woulda made things just a little easier, knowing who we were lookin’ for. So how the hell you expect Alt to help us? I saw her get decommed.
Well, looked to me like...
You're pushin' bullshit. Heard more than my share of tales 'bout runners who ran off to Never-Never Netland. Just never thought you'd be the next to tell me one.
When’d you find out?
And? What'd she say?
What? Why?
So... What did you do?
Then headed back to Arasaka Tower.
How d'you know Alt's still around? It's been a half century, which you've spent cloistered in Mikoshi. NetWatch coulda hunted her down years ago.
And Rogue went with you. Again.
Said it yourself - she was the best. Had 'er pick of contracts. But for some strange ass reason, she took a job from a rocker with a death wish. A rocker forever getting his ass beat by Arasaka.
Voodoo Boys think they know where she is - beyond the Blackwall.
And Brigitte's primed to go there, break through. Just to contact Alt, talk to her.
Sure felt like more than a moment. Saw a good chunk of Johnny's life... And Alt.
Emotion, yeah, plenty of that…
Construct - what kinda shape's it in?
What the hell's that mean?
So... did it work?
So actually... you've got no idea what's beyond that thing.
And these shapes I'm seein....
I held up my end of our deal. Your turn. Before you pass through that wall, I want Johnny's psyche removed.
Fuck... Might've guessed. Never had any intention of helpin' me, did ya?
Don't got much for options, do I?
How do I get to the other side?
Brigitte?
Alt?
What the hell's goin' on?!
W-what...?
Alt...? Wh-what's goin' on?
Alt...?
What of Brigitte and the Voodoo Boys?
"Purge?" Mean they're dead, all of them?
Brigitte - what'd she want from you in exchange for Johnny?
Dammit. I brought NetWatch here. Agent I dealt with must've slipped me a tracker that led 'em right in.
Prolly how they got to you.
What'd you do with Brigitte? She still alive?
As you can see, Johnny's got it all thought out. But there's the question of what you'll want in return.
Got no clue who you are now. Know a little about who you were. And Johnny, that he was important to you, while I'm no one. So I'm askin' - what's it gonna cost?

This chip, the Relic, it's killin' me. Construct on it is wormin' its way through my neural system.
Your death wasn't Johnny's fault.
Seen you in his memories... It was an accident.
If you're not Alt, who are you?
Mind unloadin' this baggage later? Wasn't sure what to expect from a meeting with on AI, but It sure wasn't digital spat.
Aa, didn't make it any worse. OK, I get it, you hate Johnny's guts. But what about me?
What? But it's your tech, you created Soulkiller.
Interesting... Brigitte claied she alone could help me.
Best 'runner Night City's ever seen can't bust into Mikoshi on her own?
What can you do for me, exactly?
So... you'll save my life but flatline me along the way?
The rest?
Right, so we got a plan.
Johnny, uh... embellishes, in case you hadn't noticed. You don't trust him, which is fine, but you have my word we'll slip you inside Mikoshi while keepin' you outta harm's way.
So, we agreed?
How'll I contact you once I'm ready?
Ughh... ngh... fooo...
No thanks to you, I'm sure.
So it's OK to make me the fool. That how you do biz? Maybe I oughta give Alt a heads-up?
No, waste of time, waste of breath. Thank fuck my biz with you is done. Want nothin' to do with ya.
As much as it tickles me too, we gotta delta.
Hm. Gotta be pretty disappointed.
That you can't zero me after all.
D'ya hear about Brigitte's ask from Alt? Or was that memo way above your pay grade? Like the biochip was?
Bingo. How'm I doin' so far?
You watchin’ a story on the Arasakas or narrating porn...?
Whatever you gotta say - say it.
Know what? 'Fraid I don'T got time for chit-chat.
Still got better prospects than a carbon-copy ghost of a washed-up rockerboy locked in a trinket.
This the part where you divulge your master plan to annihilate Arasaka?
Got somethin’ eatin’ at your code, that's clear.
You're a dick y’know.
Sure seem to know a lot about my past.
Pisses me off that our memories blend, don't have my own anymore. Chip's the worst thing to ever fuckin’ happen to me.
An arrogant asshole's no small problem, but it ain't my biggest. Dyin' is.
My memories - what do they... feel like?
Aside from what you see and hear, I mean. You process or experience any feelings?
You afraid of death? You afraid of death?
Like Arasaka Tower?
Honestly, I'm scared of the day I'll start seeing your memories as my own.
Listen, will I notice the change? Or, is it one of those things where I'll wonder why I ever feared it?
How do you find life under my skin?
Can you just tell me what you want? What you really want?
Don't think I care. What does interest me is why you're a clingy creep.
But your plans make no sense. Destroy Arasaka? I don't even know what that means.
Not having control - you can't stand it. Seeing some things're outta your hands...
Whole world used to revolve around Silverhand. Now, no one gives a shit.
Know what? Seems to me you need to have a nemesis, at all times. Ideally a crazy powerful one to feed your ego... and the've gotta be practically unbeatable - to justify a suicide run.
Actually, that's what I am, that kind of nemesis - I'll decide your fate, fuck all you can do.
As I see it, you don't know what you really want, so you concocted a bogeyman to fight - Arasaka.
Got a new life, you did, but you got exactly no idea what to do with it. Honestly, don't differ a bit from those poor bastards handcuffed to the feeders in their megablock pads.
Your goal's to bury Arasaka, demolish it. Mine's to stay above ground. Seem pretty clearly defined, both.
Ah, there it is - the crusade. Get to Mikoshi, smash the system.
All right.
Might be right, can't really argue with you there.
C'mon, don't exaggerate.
What happened with the Voodoo Boys?
You sound sceptical.
You think that's what happened to the Voodoo Boys?
Hey.
Choom of mine earned a spot on the menu here.
Remember his drink, the recipe?
And a splash of love.
A Jackie Welles.
Need a fixer. Got somethin' that can't wait.
Rogue? Wanted to talk.
Name's V.
The girl - what was her gripe?
Need your services. Gotta track a guy down.
Anders Hellman. Hot-shot engineer. Worked for Arasaka.
Huh. Thanks.
Wanna go through obits? Really? Fine. Johnny Silverhand. Zeroed inside Arasaka Tower, before your very eyes. Got more, if you want. Or we could just talk.
They knew the risks. All sorts of shit happens - to all sorts of people. Even to the best. To you, too, Rogue. Arasaka Tower... 'member? Who'd you lose back then? Johnny something...
U-huh. And if I don't have the scratch? It's "fuck off and have a nice day"?
Mhm. Then, see ya. Soon.
Should be enough.
Here to see Rogue. Expectin' me.
Hey, Rogue. Got the scratch.
Got the cred for the Hellman job.
Hey Rogue. I'm back. What about Hellman?
Hope you found him.
Matter of life and death.
To your health.
Thanks, but I'll pass.
Think she'll help?
Let's see what you got.
Prolly keeping him hidden from Arasaka. Must've worked on a top-secret project.
Think you can track him down?
Think Hellman might be in one of 'em? Thing is, which one?
Our boy, Hellman.
Data's all confidential. You just snap your fingers and it falls in your lap?
So what's the bad news?
Mhm. No way to 'jack the transport without the NCPD picking up on it.
A dead zone. I'll grab him there.
Even tracking that AV'll be a bitch. Familiar with the type, saw models flyin' around during the war. They're mammoth but they're quick. Plus they pack next-gen defenses. Can't take potshots at it, not even with serious firepower, dust won't work.
So, a native. Know any hick mercs?
“Won't have a choice?” Does not sound enticing - not for her not for me.
Can't possibly afford to blow this chance at nabbing Hellman.
Strange. Thought nomads gave the city, and city folk, a wide berth.
Why's Panam gotta help me? I sense a catch. Pretty big one.
She run into a hitch?
OK, guess I can try to help her. But if we don't know where to look, I mean--
You know, but wouldn't tell Panam? Aim to play cat and mouse with me, too?
Huh, I'm 'er only chance. And she's my only chance. Two pawns on Rogue's board.
So tell me. Fine. Lemme hear what you know.
All clear, Thanks.
Ugh... gonna puke...
Hey, Panam. Got your number from Rogue. Name's V.
This Panam? V here.
From Rogue.
From someone at the Afterlife.
Actually, wanted to talk about what you want.
The merch you lost and your ride... want 'em back? Let's talk.
Forget Rogue for a minute. I wanna help you.
Tell it to your therapist. Callin’ about your ride and the merch you lost. Interested? Or are you gonna tell me to eat your shorts, too? -> [3]
This thing between you and Rogue? Couldn't care less. Got a job for you.
With the merch and your car? Getting 'em back? I can help with that. -> [3]
See ya.
Hey, Judy. How ya feelin’?
Gotta give yourself time to grieve, Judy. Experience all its stages, feel them, let employ out. Shock, anger, depression…
So what'd you come up with?
I'm familiar with the story. Things did not go that smoothly.
You sure you've thought this through, Judy, carefully?
Got the Mox to agree to take over Clouds?
Fine. Got me on board.
OK, so. What's the plan?
Maiko Maeda... who is she, exactly?
What's she do officially?
You sure Maiko's gonna wanna join forces?
Let me rephrase. Is there any chance she'll stop us around, then shove us out her megatower window?
Guess I can work with that. How well do you know this Maiko?
When we doin’ this?
How early?
On the balcony. Got it.
Some detes about her could be useful, when I talk to her, don't you think?
So, in brief, I'm just here as your huscle, right?
How you aim to get her over to our side?
Think that'll cut it?
You seem a bundle of nerves.
I'm ready, let's go.
Looks like you've come this way before. More than once.
Sounds like I left a mark on this place. Good.
Don't mind me - just here to blend into the decor.
To make sure Judy gets what she came for.
Judy has a proposal... about Clouds.
Judy's idea - think about it. Could work.
Call me a murderer? You're right - I killed Woodman. I'd do it again in heartbeat. And if I'd known what he did to Evelyn when she needed help, I wouldn't've have gone so easy on him.
Doesn't it make you wonder why you even work here?
You picked the wrong side, Maiko.
Prolly needs time to think. Couple of days, tops.
You two have a history?
Like everyone in Night City.
Can't trust people that see everything as a numbers game. Line between potting you on the back as their friend, and planting a knife in you as their enemy, is down to a decimal.
A little unwindin'd do you good. Do me good too, actually.
Yeah, you, a deckchair and a Mai Tai with a cocktail umbrella - somehow don't see it.
Hey, if it works... I mean, blame the corps all you want, but at the end of the day, says more about us than them. Biz is biz 'n' tits're biz.
Appealin' to her sense of justice wasn't big enough?
For a minute there, thought you were about call it quits.
Miniscule?
Y'know... I'm also partial to specifics.
Art and dreams of freedom can't be everyone's food. Sometimes... you gotta deal with the dirt. So - what now?
Judy. So, you got a plan?
How’d you manage that?
A and A, artichokes and avocado flavor. And Zucchini for good measure.
Gonna tell me this big secret of ours?
Sounds like my kinda plan.
Course I'll be there.
Hey, Panam?
Why's it matter? What's wrong with this one?
We can help each other. Rogue said so.
Ahem. Agree to help me, you'll find out.
to [1]
Fuck me. You always on the warpath?
I tell you, and then what? Gonna storm off, handle it all by yourself?
Listen to me. LISTEN TO ME! You need my help. And you'll get it. I mean that. Right after we solve my problem.
to [1]
Hey, c'mon. Calm down?
Fine. Know where to find the cargo and your car. But you go alone, you wont get ‘em back. And you could lose something else besides... So let's figure something out.
One guy I gotta talk to. A corpo travelling by corp convoy.
It's just one AV. Planned route'll take it over Jackson Plains.
Need to hit a Kang Tao transport. Won't be easy. Wanna know I can count on you.
About you or the job? Kang Tao's AV route'll take it over Jackson Plains. Heard that should help us.
Gonna be a guy on board. Need to talk to him.
In return, info on your cargo, help in getting back what's yours. We got a deal?
Thought this was mostly about the merch?
Car’s in Rocky Ridge. You're supposed to know where that is. Car's there, goods’re there.
Nash a choom of yours? He hang you out to dry?
Heh, fine. Partner.
Rocky Ridge. Let's go.
Wanna tell me where?
Gave that meathead your word, and he took it?
Boz? Vista del Rey Boz? Had no idea you drive for 6th Street.
No, nothin’ wrong with it. They still wild about stars, stripes and core, heartland values?
Who the hell's Boz? Won't cause us any grief, I hope.
You drive for gangoons?
So - where to now?
Don't seem too excited.
Y'know, used to ride with nomads, too.
Yep - Bakker clan, back in the day. Didn't work out 'tween us, so I landed in Night City.
Rogue mentioned your friends. Said you guys stopped seeing eye to eye.
It isn't?
Ooo-k, then.
So it's complicated.
Any chance they might help us? In Rocky Ridge?
Good, let's roll.
Where'd you get the ride? Straight outta some driveway in Rancho?
For me? No, not at all. I mean, there's no accounting for taste.
Nice ride. Lots of space. Practical.
How far's the camp?
How the hell’d you land in this mess?
You know I don't mean the car.
This particular clown's got Intel I need. And I'm running out of time to get it.
Rogue? Do better not to wonder what her agenda might be.
Know what? Screw Rogue. Can't see why you even care.
Don't let her push you around. She's not the only fixer in town.
But I'm not the one bitching about her.
Rogue's queen of the Afterlife. Plays her pawns as she pleases.
I got a good look at 'er. She rose to the top ‘cause she reads people. So what if she keeps things to herself? It's a skill in her profession.
Guess you'll have to ask her yourself.

Wait, Nash is Raffen?
Mhm. Nomads tossed out of clans.
Shit.
But seriously - didn't realize Nash was Raffen?
Don't you keep track of who's in the area? The Wraiths, right?
Nomad blood.
Must've had her reasons.
Might not've known that side of him.
Hey guys.
Not a babysitter. Partner in crime.
Well, might not’ve needed a babysitter if you hadn't lost the merch and the car.
Nah. It got klepped.
Panam, time's short, c'mon.
Need your help.
Raffens screwed Panam. Plan is to show 'em that was a bad idea.
Really could use your help.
We'll manage without 'em.
Panam...
Looks like you're stuck with me.
You disappointed?
What's inside?
Seems you got a real problem with authority.
Rogue, Saul... He your leader?
Seemed in a hurry to delta the hell outta there.
What happened?
Mitch and Scorpion seem good souls.
Still treated you like you're one of them. They care about you.
V: Haven't been so lucky.
Not right now, no. Could just be a matter of time, though...?
Were those two in the army?
Panzerboys? Flew those huge transporters?
So, Rocky Ridge - empty, dusty hole in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, I heard. Natives either moved to Night City or just got the hell out.
How many ghost towns you think are there? Hundreds?
What's that?
Whatta we do?
Doubt Rocky Ridge could be any deader. Everything's down, nothing works here.
No dice. Nothing's up, all cut off.
I got nada. You have an epiphany?
No dice. Nothing's up, all cut off.
Oooo-k.
You got it. Found the breakers. But there's no juice on 'em.
So, classic route - good ol' diversion?
So we give them a little light show at the intersection?
Think flippin' on the lights at the intersection'll give us the upper hand? Really?
Fine idea. Let's get us some power. I'll look around for access points.
Relax. Got a few Ideas. I'll try to play a little game with 'em at the intersection.
Soon as they see the lights, they'll have to check who, why and how - nova.
Red cable connected.
You got it.
Yes, ma'am.
Switchgear's got power.
Now we wait.
Raffens'll come from where? Any idea?
Got it. Cover me, just in case.
Really, really hard to miss.
Sounds great.
Let there be light.
Colorful bunch.
I've been made.
Better off not leavin' anyone to tell the story.
Sure, sure. Leave the driving to the pros.
There. Couldn't wait another minute, could ya?
Dreamy, indeed. No surprise you wanted her back.
Sentimental attachment I get, but... a car's a car.
See? Managed just fine without Mitch and Scorpion.
It's not? You got the cargo, you got your car...
Panam...
And I don't care. The car and the merch - that's what we were after. We got them. Sixth Street awaits word, and I...
So it was about vengeance. The whole time.
Either you're not bein' straight with me, or you don't know what you want. Hard to say which is worse.
A Nash hunt wasn't part of our deal.
All right... So where's this hideout?
Let's do the deal with Sixth Street first. We can talk about Nash later.
You really wanna raid the Raffens' den NOW? Holdin' the merch you literally just got back?

No. Not what we agreed. [to 1]
Wanna just show up at the Raffen hideout? Are you out of your mind?
Matter of fact, I do. We take the stuff to Sixth Street, then go after Hellman like we planned!
All right... So where's this hideout?
No. Not what we agreed.
Not about to risk everything to settle a score that isn't even mine.
No, Panam. Nash made a fool of you, I get it. But don't try an' make one out of me. We hand the goods off to Sixth Street, then set up the Hellman grab. That was our deal.
You mad at me?

Not talking to me now? Real mature.
Come on...
To talk. Like normal people do.
You pouting like some wounded puppy?
Why? Aim not to talk for the rest of this thing?
Panam...
Dunno about you, but I'd rather you kept your word and things'd be cool between us. Are we all right?
OK.
All right... So where's this hideout?
I get it. Know how you feel. Had someone betray me, just like that, once.
Never got the chance. Someone else got to 'em first.
No doubt, without skippin' a beat.
If there's one thing I've learned in Night City, it's that sometimes revenge is not sweet. Always stand to lose more than you might gain.
Let's get 'im.
So, feel any better?
Mean to say she used to be sweet and alluring?
Let's get 'im.
So, feel any better?
Mean to say she used to be sweet and alluring?
Sixth Street not likely to pull anything?
Sunset Motel - what's that?
Should be fun.
Sensing trouble?


We work together.
Mean to say she used to be sweet and alluring?
Raffens wiped, Sixth Street's pleased. Pretty good day for Panam Palmer.
So, that package for Street - what was it?
They trade in 'em?
[Drink - to your ride!] Well - here's to that Thorn of yours!
Thanks, won't partake, myself] Don't really feel like drinking. But don't let that deter you.
[Drink - To what's ahead!] Cheers - here's to what's yet to come!
Listen, you and Saul... Who is he? Your leader or chieftain?
Were pretty keen to delta the hell out of there before he got back.
What happened?
The Aldecaldos - think you'll ever go back? I mean, not right now, but... someday?
But on the other?
Could always try it out, see who you become in Night City. 'Cept… city doesn't always play fair. Dunno if it's worth sacrificing your friends along the way.
Sooner or later, Panam, the city'll suck you in. Won't need to cut whatever ties you got left to the Aldecaldos, cause the city'll do that for you.
The Raffens - we done with them?
All right time we looked to my needs. What's the plan for Hellman?
[Sure, good idea.] Mhmm, good idea, let's do it.
[How about we just meet here later?] Know what? Whaddaya say we meet back here later. Got things to do in town.
[Maybe just one room?] Maybe we rent just one room?
Not quite what I had in mind...
Just, um... Ehm, glad to have met you. Heh, so I thought....
Maybe... calls for a little celebration?
G'night.
Ugh... gonna puke…
You known Panam for long?
Could use a drink.
[Hey, Panam.] Hey.
[Need a hand?] Can I help?
Can't complain.
[Optional - And you? Rested?] And you? Reasonably rested?
Really?
Yeah... let's hope so.
[Given our plan any thought?] Come up with anything? For Hellman, I mean.
[Lean in - OK, hit me with it.] OK, tell me.
That ol' HMG of yours?
[Optional - Why's the AV gotta come down there?] Why down the AV there, at that exact spot?
[Optional - Explain it to me again.] Hold up, one more time. Wrench is our car, right?
[Satwave power station?] Um, satwave power station?
Mhm, so far so good. But then what?
'Course we do.
Meaning what? Engines'll shut down?
[Streetcred ?, Optional - AV'll fly over the power station, we're sure of that?] Aren't you, um, counting chickens? We can't actually know the AV'll fly over the station.
['Member, need Hellman in one piece.] 'Member, need Hellman alive, unharmed. Gotta try not to blow the AV to bits, OK?
[Step away - Well, let's get to work.] All right. Let's ride.
Who owns this power station? Gov or corp?
Hey, I'm just wondering whose toes we're about to step all over.
[Optional - And you like to mess with the corps, huh?] You like to mess with the corps, huh?
Or wait, scratch that. Rogue, Nash, the Raffens...
You just like to mess with everyone.
[Optional - Subject change! What's the weirdest thing you've ever smuggled?] Mhmmm. And now for something completely different. Weirdest thing you've ever transported - go.
C'mon, answer.
That's chauffeuring, not smuggling.
Really? Dead?
Do we really have to waste our time on this?
How should I connect? Personal link?
Wired in.
Uh, I've got a bioprocessor in my head that operates independently of me. Probably why your diagnostics flagged it.
But no data will leak out of it through the personal link. Your ride's secure.
It's not a virus. Just a little malware. You get used to it eventually.
Will it affect the calibration?
Calibration's fine, but your soft could really use an update. Scanner controllers - all a couple generations back, at least. There's better tech in the bargain bin at a Kabuki flea market. I can help you with that, you know.
So where's this power station?
This a plug for the word corpo or do you have a point?
Let me remind you, I want Hellman for me, not to stick it to Arasaka. This is life or death. MY life or death.
Could be something to that, I suppose... What happened to us, it must've had some effect.
But it goes both ways. Maybe you're becoming more like me.
Power station serve the whole city?
Guess we're about to find out.
Huh, antennas run all the way down the interstate...
Let's go get 'er.
Panam, what if we cut all the cute stuff and blow the station up?
"Overload the system." Yes, ma'am - when do I start? Although... hopin' that's not too complicated. Is it?
Crank it up to eleven. Got it. So, what now?
Got it.
Done anything like this before?
Power station, EMP, the systems, networks... came up with a really solid plan.
Triple A?
Got one word for you - T-shirts.
Your method, Triple A - that all you?
What if, uh, something goes ass up?
Gotta say, almost had me believing just that.
Seems Rogue was right.
What? She said you were good. And she was right.
Know what? Think I figured you out.
Either pull off this mission or prove Rogue wrong - choose one.
[Jack in] OK. I'm ready.
I'll deal with 'em!
Is that all of 'em?
Agh shit... Ughh... ngh... fooo... Ooof... c'mon... breathe...agh... Shit! Think we mighta overdone it, Panam!
Girl, you wanted eleven, you got eleven!
Thanks for the tip. Y'know, I was just about to set up a picnic, maybe lay out, work on my base tan...
Johnny? Johnny?!
What about the detonator? Is it workin'?
OK.
Always wanted to push the big red button on somethin' like this. How do we know when?
What?
Blastin' shit - 'zactly what the doc ordered.
We only got one chance, Panam. Let's not screw it up.
Just noticed.
It's quiet. The hum of the city, people's voices, the smells... It's all gone. Wind just intensifies it. Think I forgot quiet exists.
Thought that was just the air freshener in your Thorton.
Boom. There she is.
What's going on? Goddamnit all...
Panam! The engines are still runnin'. Fuck! They're gettin' away!
We gotta go after it!
Panam, what're you doin'?
It's losing altitude!
Let's go!
No way it stays in the air after a blast like that.
Drones?
Panam! Problem! Not shooting!
They're on our tail! Panam!
Panam?!
Time being's all we need.
Saw it! Behind that hill!
Panam? You OK?
Think you can manage?
Let's check it out.
They won't mark us?
Let's roll. You connecting to visual?
I know. I know...
Connected. I'm in control.
Combat drones - defense systems active.
Got five Kangs on patrol.
I - I'm sorry. Your clan?
Don't worry. We don't know for sure...
Can't we take it down somehow?
Probably keepin' Hellman in the AV.
Listen. We saw Mitch. They prolly got Scorpion, too. We'll find them help 'em out.
They're alive. Everything's gonna be OK.
You're already blown to bits.
No. You stay in the car. Sorry, but you're just gonna slow me down.
Listen, I get that launcher outta our way, I'll let you know. Then you go in and help me with the rest. Deal?
OK, here's the plan - you stay in the car, I...
Panam, hate to break it to ya, but you're hurt. Wait in the car. I'll try and take out the launcher.
Good idea. Let's move.
Path's clear.
Now!
Easy, now. Not too late for everyone to wolk outta this alive.
You don't see the shit you're in?! You shoot him, and a millisec later you'll eat lead, too!
Listen. This isn't about you. Let him go and tell me where your passenger is.
You don't know, or you don't wanna say?
Look around! You're fresh outta choices.
Panam! Oh shit...
Scorpion, the rest... I'm sorry we didn't get here sooner.
The pilot didn't have to die. He was this close to caving.
He was terrified. All he wanted to hear was that he had a chance to get outta this alive.
The guy coulda been useful. I would've given him a chance.
I understand, Panam. I do. But I still think we coulda played this better.
I just think you're a little too trigger-happy, Panam. Should think before you shoot. First you wanted to kill Nash, now the pilot...
I understand that part, Panam. I do. But the pilot still didn't have to die. Woulda been useful alive.
Eh, you're right. Woulda done the same. He'd still be more useful alive than dead.
No point arguing. Still got things to do.
Why dive straight for the AV? Didn't notice the markings?
Everything OK? You need anything?
Sorry about your people, but I need to keep movin'.
I need the guy who was ridin' this AV? You know anything? See anything?
Where?
Must be lookin' for a way to call base.
Yeah... We tried to warn you, but... couldn't connect.
Panam, listen. I know It's not the best time, but I need Hellman. Your promised to help - that still hold?
I'll go after 'em. Stay with Mitch. I'll be fine.
Scorpion and the rest... Look. I know how you feel. I mean it. I'll help you settle your score with Kang Tao.
Wonder why you're stayin on board. Is it just about revenge?
Hah, true. Thanks.
No, and you know it.

We're in this together. To the bitter end.
Ah, so that's what this is? Just paying your debts?
Oooh, so I'm one of yours now? Sounds good.
Let's ride. Hope they didn't go far.
Our guys were here. Let's follow, find them.
He knew you that well?
Sounds like a real adventure.
Hey, I know... But look, you're alive. Still got a few things to take care of, too.
The rest must've taken Hellman with them.
Better hurry, then.
Dunno if we'll find anything else here.
Better check where Kang Tao took him. Fast. You were right. Nomads' car did die.
Gave us a few minutes, maybe. But they still got a head start.
Left a few peeps behind at the airstrip, rest went with Hellman.
They're comin' for 'im, don't worry.
What?
Panam...
Drones, patrols... definitely set up shop here.
We'll know soon enough.
I see cars. Nomad.
The hell are you doing here?
Don't look too concerned.
Brought a man with them, a man I need. Civilian. You must've spotted him.
Where're they holding him?
Thanks. If I were you, I'd stay put for a few.
Know where they're keeping Hellman. Going in.
You even get any customers out here? Shit, anyone even drive this way?
In exchange for your terrible memory?
Hey, easy. We gotta talk.
Not a fan, I take it?
Don't take this personally.
Yeah, just a sec. I'll call 'im.
Takemura saved my life, remember?
Takemura? Good news. Got Hellman.
Alive, alive. Not too talkative now. Taking him to the Sunset Motel.
You got it. See ya.
True.
Sure is.
Stay right there.
Just gotta ask him a few important questions.
Look, Saul, it really wasn't Panam's fault.
Panam was just helpin' me. It was my doin’, my fault that AV got hit. Without me, Scorpion and his people wouldn't have gone out to grab it. That's the truth.
Hey, don't worry about Saul. He'll get over it.
So, what now? Back to Night City?
Saul, Mitch - they really treat you like family. Maybe you should give them a chance?
Like any family.
Hey.
Motel. Middle of nowhere.
Doesn't matter. You're not leaving here by yourself anyway.
Wanna talk about your little invention. Biochip you made for Arasaka.
No.
Nobody sent me. I got a problem, and you're gonna help me.
You misunderstand me. There is no offer.
Your tech's tryin' to kill me. Pretty sure that's not how it's advertised.
Got Johnny Silverhand's construct stuck in my head. And I don't want it there.
Got Silverhand's construct in my head. It's literally driving me crazy, and I know it's only gonna get worse. That is, unless I remove it. And that, none of that's on the billboards I saw. Not even in the fine print.
Long story.
Klepped it off Yorinobu Arasaka. Job for a client, but the client left me out to dry.
Actually, wasn't a bad idea. Construct rebooted me when my own goddamn head took a bullet.
You have to remove the biochip from my system.
Look, you made the thing, didn't you? So where's the problem?
I know you can't just yank it out. My ripper said...
I needed help. Or did you think the first thing that came to mind was downing a Kang Tao AV?
How's the prototype version different? It's got a different engram? Something more...
...aggressive?
And it was rare as fuck and cost a fortune, yeah.
How do you put a price on immortality? Who could even afford tech like this?
So if it weren't for Yorinobu, nobody would've found out.
How exactly was this new version supposed to work? Were you planning to have the engram kick people out of their own bodies? Is that shit by design?
Y'mean dead?
Huh, imagine my luck, to be so fucking unique, so fucking exceptional. That mean you'll help me?
Yeah, yeah, great your tech works. Now get it out of me.
Whoa. We just met. Haven't built up that sorta trust yet.
OK.
What? What is it?
Impressive, isn't it?
Tell me how to get rid of it.
Wait, you said the project was in the trial phase. You don't actually know how it'll end.
So no matter what, sooner or later the engram wins?
What exactly is going on in my head?
Didn't come here for the philosophy lecture.
I can see him and talk to him.
When it comes to my decisions, Johnny really is just a voice in my head. Maybe he has a different opinion, but he can't make me do anything.
What do you mean?
At least Johnny never whored himself out like you.
No.
Johnny...
Know what? That's enough. You just playing for time? Because I can't tell - are you trying to convince me you're useless? I mean, in that case, I can just shoot you in the head and save us both some time.
"I'll try" just isn't gonna cut it. Actually, it's almost like you're trying to buy your way in with the Chinese... at my expense.
Forget Kong Tao. Got any other ideas?
You got it with you?
He's got a few questions of his own for you. You play nice, he might even save your ass.  I’m almost done.  The blueprints.
What'll you do with him?
Are you serious?
He's all yours. I'll give you two some space.
Fuck...!
Blah blah blah, fuck Arasaka, blah blah, smash Mikoshi.
Can't say I'm excited 'cause you're a manipulator, an egotist, and a cynic... Every time you open your mouth you gotta bury someone.
Do I gotta remind you how this came about?
Dunno what's happening to me.
-
Every cell of my being dislikes you... How can I trust you?
Let's move, get back to work.
Honestly can't fathom how you got so many people to bend over backwards for you.
You can be a charming guy - just make the effort, charisma flows.
Then I remember that nuke you detonated downtown without a second thought and no hint of later remorse.
You knew countless people would die. Don't kid yourself.
No, the maniac in my head's the problem
Got a point. Guess we make quite the duo.
Might fool someone else with that, but I call horseshit.
Whatever, won't argue. All I'm sayin' is you're unpredictable.



Every cell of my being dislikes you... How can I trust you?
Ugh. Might be right.
Yeah... maybe.
Honestly? Not sure.
Bullshit. Nothing dignifying in suffering, death... Not how legends are born.
Got no idea where I'm goin'...
Be a living legend - that's all I wanted. Feels like I'm barely survivin'.
What was it like? When you died?
Now? Had half a centory to come to terms.
Well, think I get why you detest the place.
The chosen and anointed die young. But you knew how it'd end.
You deserved to die.
'Cause you're trapped there forever, it's eternal.
They strip you of your right to die.
They can change who you are. Turn you into someone else without you even knowin' it.
They fuckin' around with the human mind, consciousness.
I dunno.
Realize what you're doin' to me is what Arasaka's doin' at Mikoshi?
Mikoshi - why'd Arasaka even build it?
Ha ha...
So, ruling hearts and minds - that's what it's about. The usual.

Let's move, get back to work.
I know. I'll be careful.
Can you chill for two secs? We go in, we talk, we leave. That's it.
Let's step to it, then.
Thanks for meetin' me.
Weren't sure of anything - if you could trust me, if Yorinobu'd killed your father. Now…?
You… knew?
You knew but didn't do a thing about it. Why? Suddenly sprout conscience just yesterday?
Helped your brother cover up. Makes you no better than him, not a smidge.
[To 1]
Ties that bind.
[To 1]
Power.
The corporation.
No idea.
Huh, guess Yorinobu's instructions were a little different.
[To 1]
Mhm, he's your brother it's been hard. It'll be hard. Let's say I get that. But what changed your mind?
Yorinobu was just plain willin' to sacrifice you.
We were gonna talk Biz, specifics.
Seem on edge. Something got ya spooked?
Think someone mighta tailed you?
'Course I didn't bring Soulkiller. 'Fraid we don't know each other that well.
Take me for a fool, think I'd fall for that? Got plans to walk outta here alive.
Meanin’? Mikoshi don't exist in realspace.
Where?
Wanna leave?
Quit buttin' in so I can hear her out.
Shut up. For one goddamn minute, shut up!
Sure know how to prick up my ears. Go on. Talk.
And you'll help me in exchange for…?
Sounds like you want to avenge dead ol' dad.
Just say it. Be easier that way.
Still vague. You want him dead.
Hm, sounds like dirty laundry, a family matter. Why should I get involved?
Hmm…
How you plan to do this?
“Testify…” Listen, mind if I'm straight with you?
Want me to throw Yorinobu under the bus in front of Arasaka top brass? Call me crazy, but that sounds like fuckin' suicide.
Like, such as…?
Let's assume it works. Then what? You take the Arasaka throne?
Figured it as a given. Besides, Takemura said you were supposed to step in for Yorinobu here in Night City.
No wish to? Or no permission? You bein' a woman.
Sure, whatever. Your biz, not mine.
Offer's intriguing. Need to think about it.
Don't like this at all. Sounds like you wanna use me.
Not the first to try.
Yeah, i-it's just, uh…
Huh?
Fuck..
Agh… I'll think it over…
No worries… 'bout that…
W-what're you doin'?
Yeah, I get it. And don't like it one bit. I'm still goin' strong.
Yeah? How, exactly?
Don't stand a chance without help.
Maybe she'd have stuck her neck out for you and century ago. But now? I don't see it.
What about Panam? She offered help.
Hanako's offer's on the table.
Oh, cut the crap! She actually has power, could be our ticket.
Gotta stop you, dickhead. What's your scheme? This is my body, I make the calls.
Agh, Johnny…
Ugh… my head.
Fuck…
Dunno, Vik… ears're ringin'. And I'm seein' shit…
Blinding lights. It's loud. I'm on stage and almost can't breathe. I'm so damn full of… hatred. Then I let it all out into a mic. And I realize it didn't help, I don't feel any better. And then, promise not to laugh. I plant a bomb in Arasaka Tower.
They killed me, Vik.  Never been so afraid.
Night City looked different… strange. And I hated it. Hated everybody, every inch.
It was too real, even for a lucid dream.
Sayin' I experienced another psyche's memories? How's that possible?
Two? Me and who, Vik, who's the other?
Hang on, mean to say there's an actual terrorist in my head - right now?
What is?
Never given me that look before, Vik. What is it?
Say what now?
Think you can top the terrorist in my brain?
You'll fix me up, right? Vik?

You're the best of the best, Vik. Why can't you help me?
I have to die, I am going to die — that what you're saying? Prove it.
Empty vessel? But I'm right here - all of this is me!
Don't omit a thing, not one dete.
Bullet in the head from Dexter DeShawn. But, how do you come back from something like that?
People don't just die and then get up like nothing happened.
What about me, my psyche? I make it back from the other side, and what? I'm supposed to pretend change is normal?
So this fucking terrorist wants to wipe me and take my place, take my body.
Can't we just take the chip out? Or switch it off?
Fuck, I remember this thing, saw it on TV… What was that stupid slogan? Soul something?
That's it! It's just supposed to let you communicate with constructs.
Vik, you've always come through for me. If there's nothing you can do to help me, then… well, what the hell do I do? Tell me, please. Vik?
And then he died… and I thought I was gonna die… with him, in my sleep.
Can't actually tell if I'm awake now. I mean, I could be dead already, right?
Givin' me a pill to prod that sonofabitch? So he can kill me faster?
The brain can be tricked. Plain old painkillers do that.
The fuck I need pills for? Oughta just stick a gun in my mouth, pull the trigger.
Gotta lie down…
Didn't you hear? My condition's terminal. What good can this do?
Really think I can make it, survive this?
Misty, wait. Umm… about Jackie…
Misty, wait. Umm… about Jackie… I'm so fucking sorry Jack's not here anymore.
Sure you'll be all right?
Where'd you even come from? How're we even talking?
Fuckin' ghost off!
Fuck!
No! Wait! Ugh…
See you never, asshole.
I'm… gonna kill you.
Ugh. Fuck me…
Hmm… why would I do that?
Can't right now... barely hangin' in there as it is.
Haven't managed to get my head straight yet, not after everything that happened.
Just trouble - usual stuff.
Quittin' Night City's not as easy as you think.
Next time through. Workin' against the clock today.
Why'd you help me, anyway?
This about the biochip? That why I'm here?
Huh. Vik likes to talk, I guess…
What's it you actually want from me?
Evelyn… what's she to you?
Been thinkin' oughta have a word with her myself. She promised to help me get rid of the chip.
Just answered your own question 'bout where Evelyn is - long gone.
Why you figure she skipped town?
You ask a looot of questions.
Might be your turn now to say something interesting.
. Got no clue. [same as the next dialogue option]
Suspect so, yeah.
Evelyn was knowledgeable about the relic, had a large chunk of classified info. An enigma, to be sure, but she showed that slyness you get in corpo agents... you know the kind.
You got tossed out, lumped with the outcasts, easily. Or have you forgotten?
Don't think so, no.
Don't matter how much perfume a corpoy sprays on mornings, by lunch that's replaced with the stench of skullduggery. Only thing I caught from Evelyn was determination.
Nope. You're startin' to stink, period.
Sorry I couldn't be of any help. Don't have any time to lose, so…
Is that all? Really should be goin'.
Pff. Lookin' for justice? In Night City?
And you think they'll trust the word of a merc?
What if I say no?
So what we stroll into Arasaka HQ and announce that Yorinobu's a kinkiller? That he murdered Saburo?
A lie-detector? Forget it.
Exactly what kind of people are we talkin' about?
Ya mean people like Anders Hellman?
Prepped for the heist, thoroughly. Relic is Hellman's design, his creation.
Let it go, Takemura.

Tom's all right. Not afraid to speak his mind, that's all.
Last thing we wanna do is to draw attention.
Thanks for the offer. Need to think about it, get back to you.
Leave? Why would I leave? Need help, best chance I'll find the right person here.
Actually, we just talked about some.
With a bit of luck, I'll track down Evelyn.
Honor among thieves - ever heard of it?
Yorinobu Arasaka'd agree, I'm sure.
Anders Hellman - he invented the Relic. If I wanna get rid of it, he's my man. And if that means picking another fight with Arasaka, so be it.
Somebody's been busy the last few days.
Your job, basically.
Defected? Where to? Some other corp poach him?
Why're you looking for Hellman?
Corpo rats'll squeal when hangin' by their tails.
She take you for a suit?
Mean to say you worked for Saburo yet got no idea how to talk to the high and mighty?
Rogue's well informed, gets wind of most things that happen in the city. Might be worth asking her about Hellman.
Till then, I guess.
You know you got some nerve. First you’re out to kill me, now you wanna be my pal? Make like nothing happened?
What do you want?!
Go fuck yourself, dickwipe!
Why should I trust you? Remind me again.
You're the ghost of Christmas past, asshole. Any Friends you had're either dead or so old their memory's gone.
So you fuckin' know Rogue. What do I say to her? Got a talking brain tumor claims it's her old friend Johnny?
Don't need convincin'. Seen your memories. Gross.
There is no "us."
How're you doin'?
Callin' to offer my condolences.
Say no more, Mama Welles. I'll be there.
Wouldn't mind one.
Been better, to tell you the truth.
That night, when Jackie fell… Let's just say things haven't exactly been easy since.
An ofrenda? Wh-what's that, exactly?
Sure some beer'd be at the top of Jackie's list.
Could help you with that.
Wanna take part in the ceremony, but… wanna do it the right way - in line with tradition.
But something I'd lay by his casket… That'd do justice to his memory, I-I don't got anything…
Jackie had a garage?
You won't mind me digging through his stuff?
Thanks, Mama Welles.
You here alone? This is not exactly the safest neighborhood in town, Misty.
What're you doin' here?
Hardly gonk at all… just, well, human.
You know each other long?
Till a year back.
Jack talked about you a lot. Always sayin' how much you meant to ‘im.
Heh, maybe, but that's what he meant. I really believe that.
What'd you see in him?
Spoken like a true Heywood boy.
How come you're outside?
Jackie never gave you a set? Who you two didn't get that far?
Mama Welles is having a send-off for Jackie. I need to find somethin' he really cared about. Ya mind givin' me a hand?
Still too soon?
Jackie'd want you here - that's more important. Come on.
Jackie loved to pump iron, didn't he?
Gotta be hanging here since 2020.
A fine piece o' metal and mechanics. Heh. He was so psyched…
Loved to poke around engines.
Knowing him, it's a miracle he never wiped out.
"For Whom the Bell Tolls" - Ernest Hemingway.
Have you read it? Is it any good?
It'd be a good tribute for the ofrenda, though.
Guess no man cave's complete without some of those, huh?
That's definitely why they're up there, yeah.
Still full.
How come?
Basketball signed by Dante González.
Like Jackie?
That a… mandala…?
Hey, you all right?
I guess you made a bigger impression than you thought.
It's beautiful.
An aquarium?
And Taco was…
Sounds like a mighty expensive fish.
Jackie's favorite tequila. Huh, still sealed.
Who--the founder of Centzon Tequila?
Wha… how'd Jackie get this one?
Nice still. It's gotta be Jackie's dad.
D'you meet him?
Leather belt?
Why'd he hold onto it?
Takin' this, yeah. Perfect for Jackie.
Better get goin'.
What happened between you two, what's the beef?
What'd she have against you?
Right. You gotta come, Misty - you got a right to be there.
You were family to 'im.
You ever thought you might leave Night City?
Seriously? Meanin'?
I, uh… often think back to the first time me and Jack met. It all started when he put a heater to my head. Then some badges showed up. Beat the shit out of us both - it's half my fault, half his. And we hightailed it out together. Half an hour later… well, we're eatin' dinner at Mama Welles'. Turned out to have more in common than we thought - principles. Jackie Welles. Best friend you could ask for, loyal to a fault. Once he set his mind on something, he was ready to die to achieve it. He once told me, "Bróder, the one thing we can't do is be afraid of others." He kept Heywood in his heart, always. It made him who he was. But most importantly… Jackie loved life and had no fear. Heart on his sleeve, he didn't overthink things. He just went for it. Thought he was bulletproof and… and that he'd become legend at the Afterlife. And ultimately, he did what he set out to do - shit in the shoes of some powerful people. And if he's watching, I bet just about now he's flippin' 'em all the bird.
He always wanted more than he got outta life. Rest easy, choom.
I see the Valentinos haven't forgotten about Jackie.
Weird bein’ here without Jackie.
Pour. For Jackie.
I'll have another.
I'm gonna miss him. Already do.
Jackie Welles.
Well, uh, I should mingle, Vik.
How'd you meet Jackie?
In the Valentinos?
Think we might know each other.
V.
Thank you. All right, why not.
Good for now, thanks.
Hey. Are you all right?
You, uh, here to say goodbye to one of your own, Padre?
Jackie, uh - did ya know him well?
So, Padre. You think Jackie's looking down upon us… from up there?
How're things in the streets?
I'm gonna move on.
Her name is Misty.
Misty. And she was very important to him. Do you understand? Go, invite her along for dinner. It's the least she deserves.
You… you sure? Jackie'd kill me if I got so much as a scratch on it.
Thank you. I'll take such good care of it.
You're not alone in thinking me dead… Thought it was game over for me, too.
Heard about the heist, I take it. Must've talked to Evelyn.
Listen, need to find Evelyn.
Know where she is?
Judy, you're my one hope, the only lead I got. I got to find her. An' I know you can help me do that.
Can we meet? Let's meet, please? You at Lizzie's?
Looking for Evelyn Parker. Know where I might find her?
Need to talk to Punchin' Judy. She in her den?
What was that all about?
Susie seems to know what she wants. She your boss?
Listen, have you seen Evelyn? Need to talk to her. It's important.
Need to find out who she was working for.
That's it. Judy, you don't need to worry - I won't lay a hand on her. Wouldn't make sense.
Megatower? Luxurious.
Give you a call, OK?
You're on engram in a fading mind. Nothing should surprise you anymore.
Why the hell not.
Name's V. And what, no “pleased to meet yous”?
Wakako Okada - the lady of Westbrook estate.
What’ve I missed this time? Enlighten me.
Arasaka and the Tyger Claws are in bed together. Go figure…
No. I mean, if Evelyn wanted to disappear, especially from Arasaka, she could've done better.
Someone's in a great mood.
Think Judy's lying? Why?
Oh, so what you meant to say was you're full of shit. Got it.
Looking for an Evelyn Parker. She work here?
Need to see her. It's important.
I'm not a customer.
Meaning?
How could you possibly know what I'm looking for?
So how's this all work?
So there'll be no trace of the meeting?
You're saying it's not dangerous, but there's some risk involved.
Consider my interest piqued. All right, let's do this.
Samurai.
Is that normal or…?
Rather go with Skye.
Not here to pay and play. Just want some info.
All right, I changed my mind. I'll pay.
There you go.
That it?
Go eat a dick, Johnny.
Would've had more choices if I didn't have a certain brain parasite.
V. Just V. Only people who know me real well can use my real name.
Welp, looks like this'll be interesting…
How'd you know I'm dying?
So what if I do? Why do you care?
There's something in those mirrors, way back…
Just what I needed - therapy with a robohooker.
Lookin' for someone named Evelyn Parker, used to work here. Know her? Know where she is?
Asked you a simple question.
You just gonna talk in circles, that it?
What's next? Meditation?
Just answer my question. Tell me where Evelyn is. Don't have time for a.. debate. Why'd the manager say she doesn't work here anymore? When was Evelyn last here? You know anything?
I was told this place'd fulfill my deepest desires. Not what I was expecting, this.
So what's it I need so badly?
That's tough. Rather let it eat away at me a bit more.
Still wanna be the best… Never gave up on that goal. Chances of getting there're starting to look pretty slim, though. Just want the world to know I was here. That I mattered.
Death is death is death. You're gone - game over.
Believe me, I've seen it. And it's fucking boring.
What I've been through - tough to move on from that. Death was something that happened to other people - hell, that I DEALT to others. Now my number'll be up. Wasn't enough. I died once. Have to go and do it again.
So what now?
Which is? You're gonna tell me?
But how do I keep up with everything that's changing…?
Thanks, um… for all this. Jeez. Don't even feel like getting up…
Samurai.
Need to talk to you.
Lotta things been going on in my head lately. But this was… different. Refreshing.
I get why people come here, come back… but I need something else. Evelyn Parker. What do you know about her?
You gotta help me. Please… I'm no threat. But she could be in trouble. Just wanna talk to her, find out if she's OK.
Anything out of the ordinary happen here lately?
A customer attacked her?
Where'd it happen?
Gonna just stand there or tell me a number?
This booth occupied now?
Need to get inside that booth somehow.
None of your biz. Can you open it or not?
Who's Tom?
Where'll I find him?
Thanks. See? You turned out to be useful after all.
Blood - fresh, not too much. Put it to a wound rather than a kill.
Sounds crazy, but… she could've been remotely hacked. A netrunner?
Looks familiar.
Evelyn's jacket. Crumpled like a tissue - must've been here a while.
Relax, ya don't need any data, don't need any detes, I'm not a customer. Here to talk to you specifically. Not to be with a doll. Tom. Is that it?
Need to get in touch with Evelyn Parker. It's important.
Mean to say she's not here?
Which was it - Osaka or Oslo?
That accident. Involved a client, did it? Found blood in her booth.
And everyone's cool with that?
Tell you herself she was skippin' town?
Where can I find this Woodman?
Woodman - who is he?
OK, Mr. Forrest then. What's his thing?
Got it.
Looking for a girl named Evelyn Parker.
But she used to. What happened to her?
Look to me like a reasonable man. I think we can work something out.
You've got info, I've got eddies. It's a fair trade. What's your price?
Oh well… Can't say I didn't try playing nice.
Doll goes missing client gets messed up, and management's just sitting there, sucking his thumb… Pretty strange for a place that advertises itself as one hundred per cent secure.
I can see it already - headline in tomorrow's screamsheets. Got all the evidence I need, too…
You're not helping. Now what…
That just might work.
Chip was busted… Could've sent her to get it patched up.
Left her purse.
All her shit's in it, though. Must've left in a hurry.
Don't have time to massage egos.
Course you do, you'd've loved to drop an H-bomb on this place.
Think Fingers's got her? Think we'll find her there?
Gah, fuck!
Jesus… the fuck do you want from me?
Lemme alone.
Wanted me dead, said so yourself.
Can't find the words to describe exactly how fucked up you are.
To live life to the fullest? See the northern lights, run with the mechbulls or with gazelles on a safari?
But why? Fightin' for some dated ideal? Pursuin' a personal vendetta?
You know you're just an irritating hallucination, right? Should just ignore you.
You fuckin' asshole…
OK, so, this Mikoshi - what is it, exactly?
Yeah, seen the memories - did a real number on ya.
Sure. That's how you became a construct.
Still don't see how Mikoshi's linked to my chip problem.
And, uh, how you plan to smash Arasaka this time? Got another nuke tucked away?
I'm s'posed to know who that is?
Jack, I got no clue where you are, happened to you… It all got so fucked up. If you… If you're there somewhere… Fuck, I… What'm I doing?
Promised I'd call, didn't I?
Evelyn's not at Clouds anymore.
Behavioral chip was damaged. 'Parently they carted her off to a ripperdoc goes by Fingers.
Know where to find this Fingers character?
Headin' there now. To find her.
So, this more up your alley than Clouds?
Got a message for Fingers. Comes from the Tyger Claws.
Two things - urgent and confidential.
Meaning you've got a choice.
You either get your shit kicked in for being slow or for being a nosy prick.
Blue butter…? Hell are they taking?
Who can blame 'em, then. Hey, you all right?
Fingers - know where I can find him?
Fingers guy - you know 'im?
Like…?
Glad to see a familiar face.
We'll find her, I know we will. After the heist, Evelyn holed up with the Mox for a while, right?
So why the hell’d she go back to Clouds?
Mox don't happen to have Fingers in their crosshairs?
Heard joytoys come out of his clinic in worse shape then they come in.
Why me?
Think Evelyn's being kept here somewhere?
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
Moment you knew where she was, you sprang into action.
You worked at Clouds?
Fingers - where'll find him?
My friend here? She's in really sorry shape. Couldn't let us cut in front, just this once?
She's a toughie. Keeps it inside, mostly. C'mon let's go.
Looking for a girl named Evelyn Parker. I know she was here in your… clinic.
Where is she?
These girls know you're chippin' faulty implants?
Heard you help the workin' girls around here.
Already told you. I'm lookin' for a woman named Evelyn Parker. Need to know where she is.
Wen jittery soon as I mentioned her name. Don't try gettin' out of this. I know you remember her.
Mox've got a low tolerance for scum like you. Right now, I'm the one thing standing between you and a particularly feisty and furious member of the gang. So tell me where Evelyn is or I'll let her to talk to you.
Mentioned you couldn't help her. Help her with what exactly?
Damage was caused by a netrunner using homebrewed malware.
Get to the point.
Don't talk to her like that.
Look, the quicker you spill, the shorter you'll have to put up with us. Now, Evelyn Parker. Where is she?
What do you mean by "underground"?
You're sure about this?
Where'll we find her?
Who'd you call? Who's your fixer?
Where'd they take her?
These guys, what'd they look like?
Really now? They looked like you…?
The two that came for her… didn't say anything about where they were gonna take her, what they were gonna do to her?
Don't worry, we'll find her. I know it.
Hey! Keep it together! Wanna give up, now?
We also know we're lookin' for something related to the Death's Head. Better than nothing.
Death's Head symbol bring anything to mind? Anything, doesn't matter how small.
Yeah, that'd make sense.
Loud and clear, you don't need to yell. What's up?
I didn't think big parties were your thing.
Could try sellin' iron straight from factory, skip the whole part where your tinker for hours on each little shooter.
Sure, I'm in. When?
Need to figure out where they're scrollin' this stuff. Gotta be a rot-hole of some sort, doubt they do much shooting on location.
Could be we'd see something to point us in their direction in one of their virtus.
Everyone, everything leaves something behind, just need to know where to look. Lucky for me, I'm runnin' around with the best BD specialist in town. That's an extra pair of expert eyes.
Lemme think for a sec. Dark net domain, that's our best bet. Let's stick to the plan.
OK, let's see, show me.
Can't believe she finds the spares to keep 'em runnin'.
Show me the range.
Lookin' for somethin' special. A braindance to really…
Nah. More hardcore.
Got anything that might interest me?
What've you got?
Any special kind?
Lookin' for BDs. A particular kind.
Cops are like kids - mommy and daddy wouldn't let 'em go off on their lonesome.
Gimme the best of the best. Ones with the Death's Head.
How 'bout a discount for your newest customer?
I'm no connoisseur, trust me.
All I need to know is who makes 'em… and where.
Where do you get these scrolls?
Just curious, that's all.
Got anything that might interest me?
Ready when you are.
Can't beat that rich synthcoff aroma - cheap shit. Cold, too. Mmmhm. Buck-A-Slice. Scav woman. Huh, who knew that 'sides citoppin' people up they were scrollin' XBD… Poor fucker. Electric Corp patch on the coveralls. Scav - gotta be. No one else with that kind of fashion sense. Ordered recently. Coffee was cold… like, from the day before. Pizza looked fresh, though.
Means someone's grabbing Buck-A-Slice regularly. Which is not something one does for the flavor and fresh ingredients. Pizza shares its DNA with styrofoam, nobody's gonna schlep across town for it. OK, we're lookin' for an Electric Corp power plant located near a Buck-A-Slice.
Radio's turned way up. Probably to drown out the screamin'. Heard shit like that before. Sounds like scavs to me. Here we go. Old Electric Corp power plant in Charter Hill. Gotta make do with that for now. Nothin' else to garner from this scroll.
No time to lose. We gotta go there.
Let's get going.
Still can't shake it… that virtu sample we sow, with the Death's Head moth… If all they scroll is snuff, then…
What do you mean?
We goin' in?
It's not gonna be pretty in there.
All right. Goin' in.
I'm here. Got no time to creep around.
Found a way down. You see my position?
Evelyn's?
Smells like propylmethionine. Must be cookin' RPM here.
OK.
I can always just get rid of 'em my way.
‘Cept these are solid steel, not the softcore, plastic kind. Even if you come here on your own, gunnin' to become a star, there's no guarantee you're ever gettin' out.
Gutted out all her implants. And why stop there? Took a few internal organs while they were at it.
Scavs… No matter how many you stomp out, there'll always be more crawlin' around somewhere.
'Fraid so.
Close to the studio, I think. You find anything useful?
What do you think? What do I do now?
Johnny, she's unconscious.
All right. Let's do this.
Now!
What's wrong with her?
She OK to be moved? No brain hemorrhages, damage to the spine?
Umm… hey, Evelyn. I need you to tell me who hired you.
Let's get her somewhere safe.
Which way?
Elevators it is, then.
Fine, have it your way. Smoke to your lungs' content.
Let's give 'em a couple. You saw how she looked.
It's not up to you, though, is it? Let's go.
Ugh…
I need to talk to her.
How's she feeling?
You're mad at her? Why?
Judy, I didn't have any other…
So I don't get why….
How many BDs did you manage to rip?
Guessin' you saw them already?
OK, show me.
Hey. How ya feelin'? Need anything? Not here to nag. Just talk. I know it's a bad time, but I gotta ask. You got any idea how to remove the biochip..? Or know anyone else who might? Listen, Evelyn. I really need your help. It's important. If I don't do anything, and do it soon, I'll die.
All right, roll it.
Mhm. Glad you managed to salvage 'em in the first place.
Can't see her face.
That or someone's working it for her.
Hmm… think I recognize these.
Veve markings.
Not enough to know what they actually mean. Heard of who might use 'em, though.
Could be the Voodoo Boys… But that's just a hunch. Can't be a hundred percent sure.
Maybe… but all of them are from Pacifica. Narrows down our search at least.
Looks like I'm goin' on a field trip to Pacifica. All right, think we got everything.
Woman who hired Evelyn… any idea who we're up against?
Now we know what happened at Clouds. They're the ones who tried to flatline her. Launched a nuke at her chip.
She knew more than they thought she know. Couldn't let that go.
Looks like Evelyn never told us the whole truth.
Her only job was to record a virtu. Pretty damn amazing she managed to organize a full-blown heist. And swipe the biochip from under her boss' noses.
Sure, why not. Nothing that can surprise me at this point.
Dunno… Haitian Creole? It is the Voodoo Boys…
We have to know what they're saying. Could be important.
OK, Judy. We're good.
Biochip we stole…? It's got Silverhand's engram burned onto it.
Digitized psyche, personality construct.
Can you… can you give me a minute? Need to go over some stuff. In my head.
Know who they are - who the woman is? Any idea how we find them?
These people - what could they want from Alt?
Got no notion whatsoever?
Thought you said nothing could help us?
Why? Worried that I'll give Evelyn up to them?
So why the worried look?
I'll ask around, make a few calls… Lemme put it this way. The Voodoo Boys wouldn't trust a cat if it walked onto their turf… But someone's gotta know a way in.
See ya around, Judy.
Ugh… How's biz going?
Good thing you got Misty here to help. Handles your griping well.
know what? Seems like you're the only person in Night City who's happy with his lot.
Got a few questions about Silverhand and this chip.
How's it even possible? Seein' him?
Tried to flatline me, Johnny did.
What can I do suppress him? Y'know, avoid my murder?
And what then?
Why'm I relivin' Johnny's memories?
Finally scrounged up enough eddies to pay you back in full.
I'm not takin' 'em all the way to my grave, Vik. Here. And thanks again for doing so much work on me 'thout ever seein' an enny.
Was thinkin' about swappin' some chrome. Got any new toys?
Wakako. Long time, no see.
Willing to bet nobody knows Westbrook like you do.
What did they do?
Can't help asking - how many of those husbands did you have?
Not afraid that tragedy will strike you?
We have some outstanding biz to settle. Remember Sandra Dorsett?
How's biz treatin' ya, Cassius?
Let's see what's good.
Oh fuck…!
Stop talking.
Checked her pulse?
How'd this happen?
Fwoo… fuck.
Don't blame yourself, won't solve anything.
Stop, couldn't watch her twenty-four seven… She'd made up her mind. Would've found a way. Always. Gotta do somethin' with her.
Not sure we should move her before the bodges get here.
Y'know… to you she was your best friend, so it's a terrible tragedy. But… they must get dozens of calls like this every day.
No, just sayin'.
Didn't know you smoked.
Heh, here.
Wanna hold on to it?
Can't wrap my head around it… I never saw Evelyn as the type to give up…
Mhm… did say so.
Wait, so you found other recordings?
Then why was it saved as a virtu?
What'd Woodman do to her? Did you see it?
I zeroed Woodman. Didn't plan on it - just how the chips landed. Glad I did, though.
Like what?
Sure you don't need anything?
Anything comes up, holler on the holo.
What's important?
Old friend, well-connected to the influential… why so mysterious? Get to the point.
That's gonna help us how, exactly?
Of all people, you oughta know Night City tests everyone's reliability - even that of "old friends." Sure about this guy? Trust him?
Fine. Where's the meet and when?
Seems pretty, uh, secluded here.
What the hell happened? Look close to awful.
Friend you mentioned here?
Willing finally to give me the spec on 'im?
Hanako Arasaka's? From the carrier at anchor in the bay? Saburo's daughter?
And what's to stop her little errand boy from selling us out?
Right, 'cause Arasaka's ranks're chock-full of those.
Sure you can trust him?
Pff. Convincing, very.
Worse. 'Cause I got plenty to lose.
Just hope he doesn't blindly follow Arasaka protocol.
Unwritten rules. Had 'em here in Night City. Could be different in Japan. If I got even a whiff of treason, they'd prep an enhanced interrogator and send two elite squads with air support to grab the suspect.
Hm. That supposed to be reassuring?
Can speak for myself, you know.
Was there. Saw what happened. Yorinobu strangled the old guy.
Not gonna like what I'm about to say. I need a guarantee I'm safe here…
All right, then. Konpeki Plaza - I was there the night it happened. Looked like your typical family quarrel, until… Yorinobu lunged at Saburo an' started chokin' him…
But you can't ignore the truth!
Sorry, but… this gonna take much longer?
Wanna help or not?
We're talkin' about a guy who killed his father to seize control of Arasaka! Gonna take an interest in this or not?
Oda. It's not as if we're asking for a whole lot, here. Just one brief meeting. Hanako should decide if what we say is true. You can't decide for her. Will you help?
Oda, you are an Arasaka soldier! This is not a request. We remind you of your duty to be truthful to your superiors.
Wasn't always what I am now. And your friend here didn't always look like a bum. Feel free to join us. Plenty of room at the bottom of the heap. Not enticed? Then do your duty. Tell Hanako what nobody else wants to hear.
Just gotta tell it like it is sometimes.
How come?
Fine friend, there. Got any more?
No way this was gonna work.
Well… can't say we didn't try.
Hm, how do you figure that?
Hold on…
Er, hang on, not so fast! Make it sound as easy as hacking a SCSM. But you said yourself - Hanako's got the tightest security in all Night City.
Know just the fixer dame - Wakako Okada. Runs a pachinko parlor on Jig-Jig Street.
Get there on my own, thanks.
Sure, why not.
Just a Night City name.
Any idea what's going on at Arasaka?
You all right, Goro?
Have shared interests - you and I. Or have you forgotten?
Good. 'Cause catching lead in Night City's easier than catching a cold - and I need you alive.
Uh, just asking? Does everything with you have to have an ulterior motive?
Hideshi, don't leave this poor guy hangin'.
Wow...
Fine, let's go.
Hideshi Hino - the comedian.
Happen to be workin' together, that's all. — [to 2]
Eddies is why. Always about eddies, Wakako. You wanna make 'em - we got biz. Doesn't get any simpler.
Would've already made the call if you intended to. Simple - you're curious to see what we got.
Need Intel on the parade that's scheduled to come through Japantown.
Goro? Remind me why Dex's fat, backstabbing ass is currently indisposed?
Butchered and dumped at a landfill by some Arasaka goon. Real shame, that.
No threat, no. Asked why I couldn't reach Dex, I answered: Just facts, nothin' more.
Cm'on, got your finger on the 'hood's pulse, know everything.
Arasaka, Tyger Claws - kinda like the family dog screwin’ the cat, huh? Can't possibly be fond of the people who killed your grandkid.
Time's the best healer? Wound like that, though…
For free? You sure?
Not at all curious what we're going to all this trouble for?
Thanks, Wakako.
Stay safe, Goro.
Just… low profile, OK? Don't start handing out autographs.
What, she doesn't "charm" you anymore? Having doubts?
Let me know if I can be of help.
what, suddenly Wakako's not a "delightful mature woman"..?
Pretty quick on the dial - just got here.
What gave me away? It's the hair, isn't it.
Makin' sure I didn't get lost?
Couldn't meet somewhere else? Not big on funerals.
You my contact? Someone finally gonna tell me about this job?
Interesting biz strategy ya got in Pacifica. No details, no names. No one knows a thing.
You screenin' me? See if I came alone? What kinda chrome I got? This some kinda test?
Who died? Got somethin' to do with the job?
Wanna talk with Brigitte. She here somewhere?
Well, my creole's a bit rusty…
Shit luck, right? All those, an' I don't know yours…
You actually sell meat outta here? Really?
Lookin' for Placide.
Ughh… ngh.. fooo…
You Placide?
Wanna talk to your boss.
Y'know, I heard a few things about you.
Voodoo Boys… best runners in town. Least that's what they say. Though nobody really knows what you do on the Net.
I mean, bleedin'-edge black soft, corporate data heists, wagin' war on NetWatch… But no one mentions… chickens.
Here I thought selling poultry was illegal) Here I thought selling domesticated fowl was still illegal. Six years poultry's supposedly had the plague. Now all of a sudden - poof - it's clean?
Told me at the chapel you're the one to talk to.
Mr. Hands sent me. Said you got mercwork needs doin'.:
I wanna talk to Brigitte.
And you'll tell me more about the job?
Where we headed?
Nah. You guys aren't exactly great at rollin' out the welcome mat for outsiders.
But now?
What do you trade in, exactly?
Yeah. A few times. You want the Animals out of the GIM? Extinct? That why you hired me?
I mean, it makes no sense, them being here. Middle of Pacifica, no backup, cut off… It's your turf. Hell, even badges don't patrol around here.
They tryna provoke you? Make you do somethin' stupid?
How many we talkin' about in there?
When do I see Brigitte?
Could fuckin' tell me what you plan to do first.
Or you'll do what? You got a line of volunteers waitin'?
Dammit, here goes nothin'…
Got a feeling we're not gonna become best friends. No chemistry.
Evelyn Parker. Ring a bell?
She did work for you once.
Why not send your own goons to the GIM?
How's that been workin' out for ya?
You two know each other?
Oh, so now you're a ripperdog, too?
Is that at all relevant? Or just a cheap scare tactic?
Y'know what? Fuck this.
Besides that, everything's OK?
Any of that a dealbreaker?
Mah, unimportant. Busted anyway.
Chip's why I'm here, why I wanna word with Brigitte. Doesn't look at all familiar?
Got a bullet to the brain. Hasn't worked since. That's how.
You know, you haven't asked about my experience, what I can do….
Once inside, what do I do?
So... Am I right for the job, good to go?
Van's definitely a custom job.
Hey, just tryin' to piece the facts together.
You record all this on your own?
But from inside the GIM - squat, right?
Tech looks pretty advanced. Doesn't scream meathead to me.
Time for a break? Think you might be needed.
Animals aren't the play here, are they?
They're hired muscle. Someone else needed them. Someone with a van all of netrunner tech. And that's where I come in? To sniff out who?
Why? What for?
We know who the 'runner inside is? What he wants?
So, aim to keep an eye on me. Shows trust.
All right, anything else I should know?
My pay - how much we talkin, and how'm I gonna collect?
Uh-huh, ‘cept then I found out you need me to be a bullet trap on enemy turf. That means my fee's just gone up.
So I do this and you put me in front of Brigitte, right?
None too fond of strangers, here, are you?
Meanin’… I best watch it?
Brigitte even know we're supposed to meet? Or did you cook this deal up all by yourself?
So "Voodoo Boys" - why? Don't seem to believe in voodoo.
Mean to say you call yourselves something else? Aaand you ain't gonna tell me, are ya? Right.
All ears, what?
Mhm. Seems so.
They know you're watching 'em?
Know the way in? Was told you would.
Anything interesting happen over there?
No one in, no one out?
Just takin’ in the sights. OK. I'm in.
Right.
It even work? Said this place was abandoned years ago.
Wait, who was that?
So… he knows I'm here.
OK, van's in sight.
OK, at the van. But no sign of the 'runner.
While I got ya here, mind tellin' me what we're lookin' at?
Who is 'they'?
What're they lookin' for, exactly?
How bad's it look?
NetWatch who?
OK, so what's on me to do?
What? Placide, what?
Then what now?
Rather not pick a fight with the Watch if I don't have to.
OK, so what do I do once I find him?
Can't just scorch him via the Net? He's gotta be jacked into the van.
What's goin' on?
That bad, huh?
Placide — what's goin' on?
Think she's had enough.
Placide?
What'd you do?
Just a second ago you tried to flatline me. And now you wanna talk?
OK, no more fuckin' tangents. Fess up — who are you?
Sorry, don't work with corps.
Not interested. Not a money job for me, just need on in with Maman Brigitte, Voodoo chefin.
You have Brigitte? And how'd you manage that?
You're bluffing. Got your back against the wall, can't budge, no room to dodge the bullet.
Oh? Want what's best for me? Altruism now part of the NetWatch mission?
Rather put my trust in the Voes than in you, by a mile.
Voodoos know black tech better than anyone. So, no, think I prefer their expertise over yours.
Got anything to back that claim? That the Voodoos wanna set me up?
Asked for proof. 'Sides, I'd know.
Fine.  And…? Nothin' outta place, no trace of—
What's your beef with the Voodoos?
Want me to guess?
Brigitte and the other one, Neptune — What's their condition?
But.. they can't sustain that…
Little taste of your own medicine? The data collection — why would you target Pacifica's runners?
This's about Rezo Agwe, Isn't it? Can’t have an indie net where you aren't welcome to protect and serve, huh?
All right, what're you offerin'?
OK, do it.
Fan of westerns, huh?
Righteous sherrif - think you mighta found NetWatch's new recruiting slogan.
Ever seen "Unforgiven"? With the Hackman guy?
Give it a shot sometime. A must-watch.
Oh, Placide is gonna be pissed...
You guys know each other? 'Runner world's a small one, I guess.
Convo's going nowhere) Think I'll just stick to my plan.
Gimme a sec…
Thanks, wasn't asking… Ugh… what happened?
Then why's my brain not a pile of hot goo?
Not about to let this shit lie.
So, what? I shoulda spilled the truth?
Felt like those words came to you awfully easy.
Gee, thanks.
Brigitte and the other guy - are they back?
Perfect. 'Cause I gotta talk to her.
Taken care of.
I'll find him.
That the other guy you sent to the GIM? Didn't make it looks like. You let loose in the GIM? With… what, exactly? A-a virus? A vectored electromag impulse? Saw it before my own fuses popped — your guys shredding tags on the NetWatch agents in Mosley's grid.
Looks like you fucked up. What's Brigitte make of it all?
He gonna pull through?
That him? That the scopsucker you sent into the mechdragon's den first?
I wanna talk to Brigitte, your boss!

I fucking dare you.
Listen, I didn't turn coat, didn't pick a side. We made a deal, is all.
Did what you wanted, 'cept 'stead of gettin' my circuits acid-fried, I'm still breathin'. That so damn wrong?
You must be Brigitte. Hard woman to find.
You know about the biochip, don't you?
That why you're talkin' to me now? 'Cause you know I got the biochip?
Not 'cause I saved your frozen ass?
If I was any ordinary "ranyon," you'd have dealt with me already.
Mhmm. Just like you. Only I came out of there on my own.
How much you know from my scans?
You recognized the biochip 'cause you were lookin' for it.
Shoulda thought about that before you tried to kill me.
Heh, biochip's not for sale. And you're not rippin' It outta me. Thing was in shit shape already before I strolled into the GIM.
Not that bad. Problem is, no one I've talked to tan yank it out without risk of death. Seein' as you commissioned the things theft, figured you might know on way to help.
Access is all yours. Want this thing outta my head ASAP.
Meant nothin' but problems ever since Konpeki. Haven't found a single soul capable of gettin' this thing outta me without scramblin' my brain. You commissioned the heist, so I figured you must know somethin'. You've gotta.
Biochip's busted. That's why I'm here. Haven't found a single soul capable of gettin' this thing outta me without scramblin' my brain. You commissioned the heist, so I figured you must know somethin'. You've gotta.
Evelyn Parker — name ring a bell?
Listen, can you help me or not?
Seriously? Haven't done enough for you already?
'Cause if you fuck up you're left empty-handed? That it?
Don't think I'm that desperate yet.
Maybe I got other options I don't know about yet.
How do I know you won't screw me again?
Fine. I'll give you access.
Then after you.
You guys sure seem to love this place. But, honestly, you don't give off a strong religious vibe.
So how come Placide didn't know about the biochip? He didn't recognize it in the scans.
Where we going?
Ugh…
Never gave him a chance.
Nope.
This an old subway tunnel?
Guess all this means you got your own SynthTech interface.
How do I know I'll come back? Do I get some guarantee?
Under YOUR watch.
How's all this any different from plain old netrunning?
OK, hang on. I wanna know what you need Silverhand for first.
Alt Cunningham… heard of 'er.
From Johnny. Though granted, not much.
Tell her what?
Construct's active. Lets me and Johnny shoot the shit every now and then.
What, think I'm hallucinating? Found myself an imaginary friend?
Tell ya one thing - doesn't shake out well for the human.
What's your plan to contact Alt?
Whoa, what? You said nothin' 'bout breakin' through the Blackwall.
Oh, come on. Not the tub.
Johnny? Looks like you're the bait. You OK with that?
What exactly do you want from Alt? All of you?
The change?
The Blackwall - what is it, exactly? I mean, I know…
That would be your Saturday morning NetWatch propaganda.
Let's do this.  Ooooh…
Ooooh…
Ooooh… OK, wh-what now? J-Johnny?
Where are we?
This is it? Seriously?
It's… it's all so alive. So real.
Seein' somethin' more than I am?
So - what now?
Brigitte..?
Thompson - what happened to 'im?
Maybe 'cause you whooped his ass to make yourself feel better.
Never told me half that about Alt.
I dunno - that you were a couple, that she wrote Soulkiller, that she's dead?
How the hell's she supposed to help us now? As a ghost?
I saw the body.
Wow. Were you going for Dickwipe of the Year?
Alt. You always treat her like shit?
And I'm wondering why. I mean, you told her you two were nothin'. You told you cared about her as far as the end of your cock.
Just tryin' to wrap my head around it. You went to rescue her 'cause you actually cared about her? Felt you had unfinished biz? Or was it just another excuse to go at Arasaka?
It ever occur to you she might've been right?
Thought that was more your style?
Lookin' at it now, with twenty-twenty hindsight, nothin' occurs to you?
Cause you're planning a reunion. You wanna ask Alt for help And you're no solo act, Johnny. Could've told me earlier, about Alt.
Woulda made things just a little easier, knowing who we were lookin’ for. So how the hell you expect Alt to help us? I saw her get decommed.
Well, looked to me like...
You're pushin' bullshit. Heard more than my share of tales 'bout runners who ran off to Never-Never Netland. Just never thought you'd be the next to tell me one.
When’d you find out?
And? What'd she say?
What? Why?
So... What did you do?
Then headed back to Arasaka Tower.
How d'you know Alt's still around? It's been a half century, which you've spent cloistered in Mikoshi. NetWatch coulda hunted her down years ago.
And Rogue went with you. Again.
Said it yourself - she was the best. Had 'er pick of contracts. But for some strange ass reason, she took a job from a rocker with a death wish. A rocker forever getting his ass beat by Arasaka.
Voodoo Boys think they know where she is - beyond the Blackwall.
And Brigitte's primed to go there, break through. Just to contact Alt, talk to her.
Sure felt like more than a moment. Saw a good chunk of Johnny's life... And Alt.
Emotion, yeah, plenty of that…
Construct - what kinda shape's it in?
What the hell's that mean?
So... did it work?
So actually... you've got no idea what's beyond that thing.
And these shapes I'm seein....
I held up my end of our deal. Your turn. Before you pass through that wall, I want Johnny's psyche removed.
Fuck... Might've guessed. Never had any intention of helpin' me, did ya?
Don't got much for options, do I?
How do I get to the other side?
Brigitte?
Alt?
What the hell's goin' on?!
W-what...?
Alt...? Wh-what's goin' on?
Alt...?
What of Brigitte and the Voodoo Boys?
"Purge?" Mean they're dead, all of them?
Brigitte - what'd she want from you in exchange for Johnny?
Dammit. I brought NetWatch here. Agent I dealt with must've slipped me a tracker that led 'em right in.
Prolly how they got to you.
What'd you do with Brigitte? She still alive?
As you can see, Johnny's got it all thought out. But there's the question of what you'll want in return.
Got no clue who you are now. Know a little about who you were. And Johnny, that he was important to you, while I'm no one. So I'm askin' - what's it gonna cost?

This chip, the Relic, it's killin' me. Construct on it is wormin' its way through my neural system.
Your death wasn't Johnny's fault.
Seen you in his memories... It was an accident.
If you're not Alt, who are you?
Mind unloadin' this baggage later? Wasn't sure what to expect from a meeting with on AI, but It sure wasn't digital spat.
Aa, didn't make it any worse. OK, I get it, you hate Johnny's guts. But what about me?
What? But it's your tech, you created Soulkiller.
Interesting... Brigitte claied she alone could help me.
Best 'runner Night City's ever seen can't bust into Mikoshi on her own?
What can you do for me, exactly?
So... you'll save my life but flatline me along the way?
The rest?
Right, so we got a plan.
Johnny, uh... embellishes, in case you hadn't noticed. You don't trust him, which is fine, but you have my word we'll slip you inside Mikoshi while keepin' you outta harm's way.
So, we agreed?
How'll I contact you once I'm ready?
Ughh... ngh... fooo...
No thanks to you, I'm sure.
So it's OK to make me the fool. That how you do biz? Maybe I oughta give Alt a heads-up?
No, waste of time, waste of breath. Thank fuck my biz with you is done. Want nothin' to do with ya.
As much as it tickles me too, we gotta delta.
Hm. Gotta be pretty disappointed.
That you can't zero me after all.
D'ya hear about Brigitte's ask from Alt? Or was that memo way above your pay grade? Like the biochip was?
Bingo. How'm I doin' so far?
You watchin’ a story on the Arasakas or narrating porn...?
Whatever you gotta say - say it.
Know what? 'Fraid I don'T got time for chit-chat.
Still got better prospects than a carbon-copy ghost of a washed-up rockerboy locked in a trinket.
This the part where you divulge your master plan to annihilate Arasaka?
Got somethin’ eatin’ at your code, that's clear.
You're a dick y’know.
Sure seem to know a lot about my past.
Pisses me off that our memories blend, don't have my own anymore. Chip's the worst thing to ever fuckin’ happen to me.
An arrogant asshole's no small problem, but it ain't my biggest. Dyin' is.
My memories - what do they... feel like?
Aside from what you see and hear, I mean. You process or experience any feelings?
You afraid of death? You afraid of death?
Like Arasaka Tower?
Honestly, I'm scared of the day I'll start seeing your memories as my own.
Listen, will I notice the change? Or, is it one of those things where I'll wonder why I ever feared it?
How do you find life under my skin?
Can you just tell me what you want? What you really want?
Don't think I care. What does interest me is why you're a clingy creep.
But your plans make no sense. Destroy Arasaka? I don't even know what that means.
Not having control - you can't stand it. Seeing some things're outta your hands...
Whole world used to revolve around Silverhand. Now, no one gives a shit.
Know what? Seems to me you need to have a nemesis, at all times. Ideally a crazy powerful one to feed your ego... and the've gotta be practically unbeatable - to justify a suicide run.
Actually, that's what I am, that kind of nemesis - I'll decide your fate, fuck all you can do.
As I see it, you don't know what you really want, so you concocted a bogeyman to fight - Arasaka.
Got a new life, you did, but you got exactly no idea what to do with it. Honestly, don't differ a bit from those poor bastards handcuffed to the feeders in their megablock pads.
Your goal's to bury Arasaka, demolish it. Mine's to stay above ground. Seem pretty clearly defined, both.
Ah, there it is - the crusade. Get to Mikoshi, smash the system.
All right.
Might be right, can't really argue with you there.
C'mon, don't exaggerate.
What happened with the Voodoo Boys?
You sound sceptical.
You think that's what happened to the Voodoo Boys?
Hey.
Choom of mine earned a spot on the menu here.
Remember his drink, the recipe?
And a splash of love.
A Jackie Welles.
Need a fixer. Got somethin' that can't wait.
Rogue? Wanted to talk.
Name's V.
The girl - what was her gripe?
Need your services. Gotta track a guy down.
Anders Hellman. Hot-shot engineer. Worked for Arasaka.
Huh. Thanks.
Wanna go through obits? Really? Fine. Johnny Silverhand. Zeroed inside Arasaka Tower, before your very eyes. Got more, if you want. Or we could just talk.
They knew the risks. All sorts of shit happens - to all sorts of people. Even to the best. To you, too, Rogue. Arasaka Tower... 'member? Who'd you lose back then? Johnny something...
U-huh. And if I don't have the scratch? It's "fuck off and have a nice day"?
Mhm. Then, see ya. Soon.
Should be enough.
Here to see Rogue. Expectin' me.
Hey, Rogue. Got the scratch.
Got the cred for the Hellman job.
Hey Rogue. I'm back. What about Hellman?
Hope you found him.
Matter of life and death.
To your health.
Thanks, but I'll pass.
Think she'll help?
Let's see what you got.
Prolly keeping him hidden from Arasaka. Must've worked on a top-secret project.
Think you can track him down?
Think Hellman might be in one of 'em? Thing is, which one?
Our boy, Hellman.
Data's all confidential. You just snap your fingers and it falls in your lap?
So what's the bad news?
Mhm. No way to 'jack the transport without the NCPD picking up on it.
A dead zone. I'll grab him there.
Even tracking that AV'll be a bitch. Familiar with the type, saw models flyin' around during the war. They're mammoth but they're quick. Plus they pack next-gen defenses. Can't take potshots at it, not even with serious firepower, dust won't work.
So, a native. Know any hick mercs?
“Won't have a choice?” Does not sound enticing - not for her not for me.
Can't possibly afford to blow this chance at nabbing Hellman.
Strange. Thought nomads gave the city, and city folk, a wide berth.
Why's Panam gotta help me? I sense a catch. Pretty big one.
She run into a hitch?
OK, guess I can try to help her. But if we don't know where to look, I mean--
You know, but wouldn't tell Panam? Aim to play cat and mouse with me, too?
Huh, I'm 'er only chance. And she's my only chance. Two pawns on Rogue's board.
So tell me. Fine. Lemme hear what you know.
All clear, Thanks.
Ugh... gonna puke...
Hey, Panam. Got your number from Rogue. Name's V.
This Panam? V here.
From Rogue.
From someone at the Afterlife.
Actually, wanted to talk about what you want.
The merch you lost and your ride... want 'em back? Let's talk.
Forget Rogue for a minute. I wanna help you.
Tell it to your therapist. Callin’ about your ride and the merch you lost. Interested? Or are you gonna tell me to eat your shorts, too? -> [3]
This thing between you and Rogue? Couldn't care less. Got a job for you.
With the merch and your car? Getting 'em back? I can help with that. -> [3]
See ya.
Hey, Judy. How ya feelin’?
Gotta give yourself time to grieve, Judy. Experience all its stages, feel them, let employ out. Shock, anger, depression…
So what'd you come up with?
I'm familiar with the story. Things did not go that smoothly.
You sure you've thought this through, Judy, carefully?
Got the Mox to agree to take over Clouds?
Fine. Got me on board.
OK, so. What's the plan?
Maiko Maeda... who is she, exactly?
What's she do officially?
You sure Maiko's gonna wanna join forces?
Let me rephrase. Is there any chance she'll stop us around, then shove us out her megatower window?
Guess I can work with that. How well do you know this Maiko?
When we doin’ this?
How early?
On the balcony. Got it.
Some detes about her could be useful, when I talk to her, don't you think?
So, in brief, I'm just here as your huscle, right?
How you aim to get her over to our side?
Think that'll cut it?
You seem a bundle of nerves.
I'm ready, let's go.
Looks like you've come this way before. More than once.
Sounds like I left a mark on this place. Good.
Don't mind me - just here to blend into the decor.
To make sure Judy gets what she came for.
Judy has a proposal... about Clouds.
Judy's idea - think about it. Could work.
Call me a murderer? You're right - I killed Woodman. I'd do it again in heartbeat. And if I'd known what he did to Evelyn when she needed help, I wouldn't've have gone so easy on him.
Doesn't it make you wonder why you even work here?
You picked the wrong side, Maiko.
Prolly needs time to think. Couple of days, tops.
You two have a history?
Like everyone in Night City.
Can't trust people that see everything as a numbers game. Line between potting you on the back as their friend, and planting a knife in you as their enemy, is down to a decimal.
A little unwindin'd do you good. Do me good too, actually.
Yeah, you, a deckchair and a Mai Tai with a cocktail umbrella - somehow don't see it.
Hey, if it works... I mean, blame the corps all you want, but at the end of the day, says more about us than them. Biz is biz 'n' tits're biz.
Appealin' to her sense of justice wasn't big enough?
For a minute there, thought you were about call it quits.
Miniscule?
Y'know... I'm also partial to specifics.
Art and dreams of freedom can't be everyone's food. Sometimes... you gotta deal with the dirt. So - what now?
Judy. So, you got a plan?
How’d you manage that?
A and A, artichokes and avocado flavor. And Zucchini for good measure.
Gonna tell me this big secret of ours?
Sounds like my kinda plan.
Course I'll be there.
Hey, Panam?
Why's it matter? What's wrong with this one?
We can help each other. Rogue said so.
Ahem. Agree to help me, you'll find out.
to [1]
Fuck me. You always on the warpath?
I tell you, and then what? Gonna storm off, handle it all by yourself?
Listen to me. LISTEN TO ME! You need my help. And you'll get it. I mean that. Right after we solve my problem.
to [1]
Hey, c'mon. Calm down?
Fine. Know where to find the cargo and your car. But you go alone, you wont get ‘em back. And you could lose something else besides... So let's figure something out.
One guy I gotta talk to. A corpo travelling by corp convoy.
It's just one AV. Planned route'll take it over Jackson Plains.
Need to hit a Kang Tao transport. Won't be easy. Wanna know I can count on you.
About you or the job? Kang Tao's AV route'll take it over Jackson Plains. Heard that should help us.
Gonna be a guy on board. Need to talk to him.
In return, info on your cargo, help in getting back what's yours. We got a deal?
Thought this was mostly about the merch?
Car’s in Rocky Ridge. You're supposed to know where that is. Car's there, goods’re there.
Nash a choom of yours? He hang you out to dry?
Heh, fine. Partner.
Rocky Ridge. Let's go.
Wanna tell me where?
Gave that meathead your word, and he took it?
Boz? Vista del Rey Boz? Had no idea you drive for 6th Street.
No, nothin’ wrong with it. They still wild about stars, stripes and core, heartland values?
Who the hell's Boz? Won't cause us any grief, I hope.
You drive for gangoons?
So - where to now?
Don't seem too excited.
Y'know, used to ride with nomads, too.
Yep - Bakker clan, back in the day. Didn't work out 'tween us, so I landed in Night City.
Rogue mentioned your friends. Said you guys stopped seeing eye to eye.
It isn't?
Ooo-k, then.
So it's complicated.
Any chance they might help us? In Rocky Ridge?
Good, let's roll.
Where'd you get the ride? Straight outta some driveway in Rancho?
For me? No, not at all. I mean, there's no accounting for taste.
Nice ride. Lots of space. Practical.
How far's the camp?
How the hell’d you land in this mess?
You know I don't mean the car.
This particular clown's got Intel I need. And I'm running out of time to get it.
Rogue? Do better not to wonder what her agenda might be.
Know what? Screw Rogue. Can't see why you even care.
Don't let her push you around. She's not the only fixer in town.
But I'm not the one bitching about her.
Rogue's queen of the Afterlife. Plays her pawns as she pleases.
I got a good look at 'er. She rose to the top ‘cause she reads people. So what if she keeps things to herself? It's a skill in her profession.
Guess you'll have to ask her yourself.

Wait, Nash is Raffen?
Mhm. Nomads tossed out of clans.
Shit.
But seriously - didn't realize Nash was Raffen?
Don't you keep track of who's in the area? The Wraiths, right?
Nomad blood.
Must've had her reasons.
Might not've known that side of him.
Hey guys.
Not a babysitter. Partner in crime.
Well, might not’ve needed a babysitter if you hadn't lost the merch and the car.
Nah. It got klepped.
Panam, time's short, c'mon.
Need your help.
Raffens screwed Panam. Plan is to show 'em that was a bad idea.
Really could use your help.
We'll manage without 'em.
Panam...
Looks like you're stuck with me.
You disappointed?
What's inside?
Seems you got a real problem with authority.
Rogue, Saul... He your leader?
Seemed in a hurry to delta the hell outta there.
What happened?
Mitch and Scorpion seem good souls.
Still treated you like you're one of them. They care about you.
V: Haven't been so lucky.
Not right now, no. Could just be a matter of time, though...?
Were those two in the army?
Panzerboys? Flew those huge transporters?
So, Rocky Ridge - empty, dusty hole in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, I heard. Natives either moved to Night City or just got the hell out.
How many ghost towns you think are there? Hundreds?
What's that?
Whatta we do?
Doubt Rocky Ridge could be any deader. Everything's down, nothing works here.
No dice. Nothing's up, all cut off.
I got nada. You have an epiphany?
No dice. Nothing's up, all cut off.
Oooo-k.
You got it. Found the breakers. But there's no juice on 'em.
So, classic route - good ol' diversion?
So we give them a little light show at the intersection?
Think flippin' on the lights at the intersection'll give us the upper hand? Really?
Fine idea. Let's get us some power. I'll look around for access points.
Relax. Got a few Ideas. I'll try to play a little game with 'em at the intersection.
Soon as they see the lights, they'll have to check who, why and how - nova.
Red cable connected.
You got it.
Yes, ma'am.
Switchgear's got power.
Now we wait.
Raffens'll come from where? Any idea?
Got it. Cover me, just in case.
Really, really hard to miss.
Sounds great.
Let there be light.
Colorful bunch.
I've been made.
Better off not leavin' anyone to tell the story.
Sure, sure. Leave the driving to the pros.
There. Couldn't wait another minute, could ya?
Dreamy, indeed. No surprise you wanted her back.
Sentimental attachment I get, but... a car's a car.
See? Managed just fine without Mitch and Scorpion.
It's not? You got the cargo, you got your car...
Panam...
And I don't care. The car and the merch - that's what we were after. We got them. Sixth Street awaits word, and I...
So it was about vengeance. The whole time.
Either you're not bein' straight with me, or you don't know what you want. Hard to say which is worse.
A Nash hunt wasn't part of our deal.
All right... So where's this hideout?
Let's do the deal with Sixth Street first. We can talk about Nash later.
You really wanna raid the Raffens' den NOW? Holdin' the merch you literally just got back?

No. Not what we agreed. [to 1]
Wanna just show up at the Raffen hideout? Are you out of your mind?
Matter of fact, I do. We take the stuff to Sixth Street, then go after Hellman like we planned!
All right... So where's this hideout?
No. Not what we agreed.
Not about to risk everything to settle a score that isn't even mine.
No, Panam. Nash made a fool of you, I get it. But don't try an' make one out of me. We hand the goods off to Sixth Street, then set up the Hellman grab. That was our deal.
You mad at me?

Not talking to me now? Real mature.
Come on...
To talk. Like normal people do.
You pouting like some wounded puppy?
Why? Aim not to talk for the rest of this thing?
Panam...
Dunno about you, but I'd rather you kept your word and things'd be cool between us. Are we all right?
OK.
All right... So where's this hideout?
I get it. Know how you feel. Had someone betray me, just like that, once.
Never got the chance. Someone else got to 'em first.
No doubt, without skippin' a beat.
If there's one thing I've learned in Night City, it's that sometimes revenge is not sweet. Always stand to lose more than you might gain.
Let's get 'im.
So, feel any better?
Mean to say she used to be sweet and alluring?
Let's get 'im.
So, feel any better?
Mean to say she used to be sweet and alluring?
Sixth Street not likely to pull anything?
Sunset Motel - what's that?
Should be fun.
Sensing trouble?


We work together.
Mean to say she used to be sweet and alluring?
Raffens wiped, Sixth Street's pleased. Pretty good day for Panam Palmer.
So, that package for Street - what was it?
They trade in 'em?
[Drink - to your ride!] Well - here's to that Thorn of yours!
Thanks, won't partake, myself] Don't really feel like drinking. But don't let that deter you.
[Drink - To what's ahead!] Cheers - here's to what's yet to come!
Listen, you and Saul... Who is he? Your leader or chieftain?
Were pretty keen to delta the hell out of there before he got back.
What happened?
The Aldecaldos - think you'll ever go back? I mean, not right now, but... someday?
But on the other?
Could always try it out, see who you become in Night City. 'Cept… city doesn't always play fair. Dunno if it's worth sacrificing your friends along the way.
Sooner or later, Panam, the city'll suck you in. Won't need to cut whatever ties you got left to the Aldecaldos, cause the city'll do that for you.
The Raffens - we done with them?
All right time we looked to my needs. What's the plan for Hellman?
[Sure, good idea.] Mhmm, good idea, let's do it.
[How about we just meet here later?] Know what? Whaddaya say we meet back here later. Got things to do in town.
[Maybe just one room?] Maybe we rent just one room?
Not quite what I had in mind...
Just, um... Ehm, glad to have met you. Heh, so I thought....
Maybe... calls for a little celebration?
G'night.
Ugh... gonna puke…
You known Panam for long?
Could use a drink.
[Hey, Panam.] Hey.
[Need a hand?] Can I help?
Can't complain.
[Optional - And you? Rested?] And you? Reasonably rested?
Really?
Yeah... let's hope so.
[Given our plan any thought?] Come up with anything? For Hellman, I mean.
[Lean in - OK, hit me with it.] OK, tell me.
That ol' HMG of yours?
[Optional - Why's the AV gotta come down there?] Why down the AV there, at that exact spot?
[Optional - Explain it to me again.] Hold up, one more time. Wrench is our car, right?
[Satwave power station?] Um, satwave power station?
Mhm, so far so good. But then what?
'Course we do.
Meaning what? Engines'll shut down?
[Streetcred ?, Optional - AV'll fly over the power station, we're sure of that?] Aren't you, um, counting chickens? We can't actually know the AV'll fly over the station.
['Member, need Hellman in one piece.] 'Member, need Hellman alive, unharmed. Gotta try not to blow the AV to bits, OK?
[Step away - Well, let's get to work.] All right. Let's ride.
Who owns this power station? Gov or corp?
Hey, I'm just wondering whose toes we're about to step all over.
[Optional - And you like to mess with the corps, huh?] You like to mess with the corps, huh?
Or wait, scratch that. Rogue, Nash, the Raffens...
You just like to mess with everyone.
[Optional - Subject change! What's the weirdest thing you've ever smuggled?] Mhmmm. And now for something completely different. Weirdest thing you've ever transported - go.
C'mon, answer.
That's chauffeuring, not smuggling.
Really? Dead?
Do we really have to waste our time on this?
How should I connect? Personal link?
Wired in.
Uh, I've got a bioprocessor in my head that operates independently of me. Probably why your diagnostics flagged it.
But no data will leak out of it through the personal link. Your ride's secure.
It's not a virus. Just a little malware. You get used to it eventually.
Will it affect the calibration?
Calibration's fine, but your soft could really use an update. Scanner controllers - all a couple generations back, at least. There's better tech in the bargain bin at a Kabuki flea market. I can help you with that, you know.
So where's this power station?
This a plug for the word corpo or do you have a point?
Let me remind you, I want Hellman for me, not to stick it to Arasaka. This is life or death. MY life or death.
Could be something to that, I suppose... What happened to us, it must've had some effect.
But it goes both ways. Maybe you're becoming more like me.
Power station serve the whole city?
Guess we're about to find out.
Huh, antennas run all the way down the interstate...
Let's go get 'er.
Panam, what if we cut all the cute stuff and blow the station up?
"Overload the system." Yes, ma'am - when do I start? Although... hopin' that's not too complicated. Is it?
Crank it up to eleven. Got it. So, what now?
Got it.
Done anything like this before?
Power station, EMP, the systems, networks... came up with a really solid plan.
Triple A?
Got one word for you - T-shirts.
Your method, Triple A - that all you?
What if, uh, something goes ass up?
Gotta say, almost had me believing just that.
Seems Rogue was right.
What? She said you were good. And she was right.
Know what? Think I figured you out.
Either pull off this mission or prove Rogue wrong - choose one.
[Jack in] OK. I'm ready.
I'll deal with 'em!
Is that all of 'em?
Agh shit... Ughh... ngh... fooo... Ooof... c'mon... breathe...agh... Shit! Think we mighta overdone it, Panam!
Girl, you wanted eleven, you got eleven!
Thanks for the tip. Y'know, I was just about to set up a picnic, maybe lay out, work on my base tan...
Johnny? Johnny?!
What about the detonator? Is it workin'?
OK.
Always wanted to push the big red button on somethin' like this. How do we know when?
What?
Blastin' shit - 'zactly what the doc ordered.
We only got one chance, Panam. Let's not screw it up.
Just noticed.
It's quiet. The hum of the city, people's voices, the smells... It's all gone. Wind just intensifies it. Think I forgot quiet exists.
Thought that was just the air freshener in your Thorton.
Boom. There she is.
What's going on? Goddamnit all...
Panam! The engines are still runnin'. Fuck! They're gettin' away!
We gotta go after it!
Panam, what're you doin'?
It's losing altitude!
Let's go!
No way it stays in the air after a blast like that.
Drones?
Panam! Problem! Not shooting!
They're on our tail! Panam!
Panam?!
Time being's all we need.
Saw it! Behind that hill!
Panam? You OK?
Think you can manage?
Let's check it out.
They won't mark us?
Let's roll. You connecting to visual?
I know. I know...
Connected. I'm in control.
Combat drones - defense systems active.
Got five Kangs on patrol.
I - I'm sorry. Your clan?
Don't worry. We don't know for sure...
Can't we take it down somehow?
Probably keepin' Hellman in the AV.
Listen. We saw Mitch. They prolly got Scorpion, too. We'll find them help 'em out.
They're alive. Everything's gonna be OK.
You're already blown to bits.
No. You stay in the car. Sorry, but you're just gonna slow me down.
Listen, I get that launcher outta our way, I'll let you know. Then you go in and help me with the rest. Deal?
OK, here's the plan - you stay in the car, I...
Panam, hate to break it to ya, but you're hurt. Wait in the car. I'll try and take out the launcher.
Good idea. Let's move.
Path's clear.
Now!
Easy, now. Not too late for everyone to wolk outta this alive.
You don't see the shit you're in?! You shoot him, and a millisec later you'll eat lead, too!
Listen. This isn't about you. Let him go and tell me where your passenger is.
You don't know, or you don't wanna say?
Look around! You're fresh outta choices.
Panam! Oh shit...
Scorpion, the rest... I'm sorry we didn't get here sooner.
The pilot didn't have to die. He was this close to caving.
He was terrified. All he wanted to hear was that he had a chance to get outta this alive.
The guy coulda been useful. I would've given him a chance.
I understand, Panam. I do. But I still think we coulda played this better.
I just think you're a little too trigger-happy, Panam. Should think before you shoot. First you wanted to kill Nash, now the pilot...
I understand that part, Panam. I do. But the pilot still didn't have to die. Woulda been useful alive.
Eh, you're right. Woulda done the same. He'd still be more useful alive than dead.
No point arguing. Still got things to do.
Why dive straight for the AV? Didn't notice the markings?
Everything OK? You need anything?
Sorry about your people, but I need to keep movin'.
I need the guy who was ridin' this AV? You know anything? See anything?
Where?
Must be lookin' for a way to call base.
Yeah... We tried to warn you, but... couldn't connect.
Panam, listen. I know It's not the best time, but I need Hellman. Your promised to help - that still hold?
I'll go after 'em. Stay with Mitch. I'll be fine.
Scorpion and the rest... Look. I know how you feel. I mean it. I'll help you settle your score with Kang Tao.
Wonder why you're stayin on board. Is it just about revenge?
Hah, true. Thanks.
No, and you know it.

We're in this together. To the bitter end.
Ah, so that's what this is? Just paying your debts?
Oooh, so I'm one of yours now? Sounds good.
Let's ride. Hope they didn't go far.
Our guys were here. Let's follow, find them.
He knew you that well?
Sounds like a real adventure.
Hey, I know... But look, you're alive. Still got a few things to take care of, too.
The rest must've taken Hellman with them.
Better hurry, then.
Dunno if we'll find anything else here.
Better check where Kang Tao took him. Fast. You were right. Nomads' car did die.
Gave us a few minutes, maybe. But they still got a head start.
Left a few peeps behind at the airstrip, rest went with Hellman.
They're comin' for 'im, don't worry.
What?
Panam...
Drones, patrols... definitely set up shop here.
We'll know soon enough.
I see cars. Nomad.
The hell are you doing here?
Don't look too concerned.
Brought a man with them, a man I need. Civilian. You must've spotted him.
Where're they holding him?
Thanks. If I were you, I'd stay put for a few.
Know where they're keeping Hellman. Going in.
You even get any customers out here? Shit, anyone even drive this way?
In exchange for your terrible memory?
Hey, easy. We gotta talk.
Not a fan, I take it?
Don't take this personally.
Yeah, just a sec. I'll call 'im.
Takemura saved my life, remember?
Takemura? Good news. Got Hellman.
Alive, alive. Not too talkative now. Taking him to the Sunset Motel.
You got it. See ya.
True.
Sure is.
Stay right there.
Just gotta ask him a few important questions.
Look, Saul, it really wasn't Panam's fault.
Panam was just helpin' me. It was my doin’, my fault that AV got hit. Without me, Scorpion and his people wouldn't have gone out to grab it. That's the truth.
Hey, don't worry about Saul. He'll get over it.
So, what now? Back to Night City?
Saul, Mitch - they really treat you like family. Maybe you should give them a chance?
Like any family.
Hey.
Motel. Middle of nowhere.
Doesn't matter. You're not leaving here by yourself anyway.
Wanna talk about your little invention. Biochip you made for Arasaka.
No.
Nobody sent me. I got a problem, and you're gonna help me.
You misunderstand me. There is no offer.
Your tech's tryin' to kill me. Pretty sure that's not how it's advertised.
Got Johnny Silverhand's construct stuck in my head. And I don't want it there.
Got Silverhand's construct in my head. It's literally driving me crazy, and I know it's only gonna get worse. That is, unless I remove it. And that, none of that's on the billboards I saw. Not even in the fine print.
Long story.
Klepped it off Yorinobu Arasaka. Job for a client, but the client left me out to dry.
Actually, wasn't a bad idea. Construct rebooted me when my own goddamn head took a bullet.
You have to remove the biochip from my system.
Look, you made the thing, didn't you? So where's the problem?
I know you can't just yank it out. My ripper said...
I needed help. Or did you think the first thing that came to mind was downing a Kang Tao AV?
How's the prototype version different? It's got a different engram? Something more...
...aggressive?
And it was rare as fuck and cost a fortune, yeah.
How do you put a price on immortality? Who could even afford tech like this?
So if it weren't for Yorinobu, nobody would've found out.
How exactly was this new version supposed to work? Were you planning to have the engram kick people out of their own bodies? Is that shit by design?
Y'mean dead?
Huh, imagine my luck, to be so fucking unique, so fucking exceptional. That mean you'll help me?
Yeah, yeah, great your tech works. Now get it out of me.
Whoa. We just met. Haven't built up that sorta trust yet.
OK.
What? What is it?
Impressive, isn't it?
Tell me how to get rid of it.
Wait, you said the project was in the trial phase. You don't actually know how it'll end.
So no matter what, sooner or later the engram wins?
What exactly is going on in my head?
Didn't come here for the philosophy lecture.
I can see him and talk to him.
When it comes to my decisions, Johnny really is just a voice in my head. Maybe he has a different opinion, but he can't make me do anything.
What do you mean?
At least Johnny never whored himself out like you.
No.
Johnny...
Know what? That's enough. You just playing for time? Because I can't tell - are you trying to convince me you're useless? I mean, in that case, I can just shoot you in the head and save us both some time.
"I'll try" just isn't gonna cut it. Actually, it's almost like you're trying to buy your way in with the Chinese... at my expense.
Forget Kong Tao. Got any other ideas?
You got it with you?
He's got a few questions of his own for you. You play nice, he might even save your ass.  I’m almost done.  The blueprints.
What'll you do with him?
Are you serious?
He's all yours. I'll give you two some space.
Fuck...!
Blah blah blah, fuck Arasaka, blah blah, smash Mikoshi.
Can't say I'm excited 'cause you're a manipulator, an egotist, and a cynic... Every time you open your mouth you gotta bury someone.
Do I gotta remind you how this came about?
Dunno what's happening to me.
-
Every cell of my being dislikes you... How can I trust you?
Let's move, get back to work.
Honestly can't fathom how you got so many people to bend over backwards for you.
You can be a charming guy - just make the effort, charisma flows.
Then I remember that nuke you detonated downtown without a second thought and no hint of later remorse.
You knew countless people would die. Don't kid yourself.
No, the maniac in my head's the problem
Got a point. Guess we make quite the duo.
Might fool someone else with that, but I call horseshit.
Whatever, won't argue. All I'm sayin' is you're unpredictable.



Every cell of my being dislikes you... How can I trust you?
Ugh. Might be right.
Yeah... maybe.
Honestly? Not sure.
Bullshit. Nothing dignifying in suffering, death... Not how legends are born.
Got no idea where I'm goin'...
Be a living legend - that's all I wanted. Feels like I'm barely survivin'.
What was it like? When you died?
Now? Had half a centory to come to terms.
Well, think I get why you detest the place.
The chosen and anointed die young. But you knew how it'd end.
You deserved to die.
'Cause you're trapped there forever, it's eternal.
They strip you of your right to die.
They can change who you are. Turn you into someone else without you even knowin' it.
They fuckin' around with the human mind, consciousness.
I dunno.
Realize what you're doin' to me is what Arasaka's doin' at Mikoshi?
Mikoshi - why'd Arasaka even build it?
Ha ha...
So, ruling hearts and minds - that's what it's about. The usual.

Let's move, get back to work.
Had no idea you and the Aldecaldos had made up.
They're family.
What happened? Spit it out.
Sure it was Wraiths?
Always, Panam. You and me're chooms. Thought that was clear.
I'll survive, I'm sure.
Sounds fancy.
You recommend any chrome in particular?
Wanna get myself chipped.
OK, how you wanna do this?
Goin' in quiet. Two's all you need.
Your leader gets nabbed and you, what, hope for the best? Rather not think about what you'd do for the ones at the bottom of our food chain.
Let's see what we got here.
Our way in.
Quite a spread... Be like looking for a diamond in a hailstorm.
OK, got some stuff to work with now.
Let's sum things up, just to be sure.
Yep, let's go get Saul.
Hope so. Doubt I could carry him out on my back.
Yeah, 'course I'm going with you.
Want me drivin'?
Said yourself he's not at the top of his form.
All had our idols...
Lookin'... bad.
Panam! I found Saul, I think. Locked in the cellar.
Pff, It's hard to say. Too dark.
Oh, Panam... Got a girl here... Dead. Disemboweled... and not just for her chrome, I don't think
Right - think I got eyes on him.
Breathing? Think so.
Saul?
Y-your cigar...?
Easy, Saul. I'm here with Panam.
Not forever. Gonna get you out.
Can you walk?
You're pretty badly beat. Prolly could use this.
Seems not bad at all. Demanded a cigar and some "companions."
Got the edge. Wraiths don't know I'm here. On our way out now!
Mhm. And if we can be just as sly together, might get out without firing a shot.
Anything else, Your Excellency?
Hehh, it's not the time for this. You're both exhausted.
I gotta agree with Panam. Sounds like a truly shitty idea.
Y'know what I always liked about nomads? Your taste, uh, no - your hunger for freedom. It's not easy to come by In Night City. The corps got their grubby claws in everything. And I just can't believe you'd hand them what you hold to be most precious.
To haboobs.
What is?
And? You think this is any better?
Have everything you need, ma'am?
How's your whiskey, ma'am?
Ma'am, I'm sure you'd be cozier with your shoes off.
Nonsense, after a day as full as today, you deserve to kick back.
Got a few ideas... Think you know what kind.
Yea-I, buhh... I-I'm sorry... Dunno what I was thinking...
Right. So... friends, then?
Nnn-nope.
Saul doin' all right?
You gotta agree now - next time I choose the motel.
Wai...hang on. Thought you were headed back to the Aldecaldos. Stayin' with the clan.
Whereas you...?
Puttin' her in good hands, Panam.
Uh, hold up... About last night...
So what are you like?
You, too, Panam.
What's with you?
How ya feelin'?
You all bury the hatchet with Panam?
Better start headin' out.
You really think you can "forbid" Panam from doing anything? Trust me - no point. She'll do whatever she wants.
Get the sense this fight's grown stale. C'mon, put some feeling into it.
Thought the Biotechnica contract had withered and died.
What's this Basilisk nonsense?
Lemme guess - whole thing's your idea?
Saul wouldn't be quite so pissed if it weren't.
This Basilisk worth another fight with Saul?
OK, so you do wanna go behind Saul's back, dragged me here specifically for that.
‘Member, a while back, told me to give you a solid kick in the pants if I saw you divin' in the stupid pool again?
Nope, different that - rescue mission. Someone from the family. Now, you're out to plain trick him.
Thought you and Saul'd agreed to bury your carbines.
Zactly. You saved his life. You wanna fuck things up all over again now?
Why's Saul got his briefs in a bunch over this Basilisk?
And you guys'd rather...?
Meanin' smugglin'.
And you plan to grab the Basilisk how?
Haven't said I'd help just yet.
So, just the four vets on board with the plan, nobody else?
Sounds pretty risky to me.
Panam's got a beef with Saul, I know. But you guys...?
It's all too... easy. Convenient to arrange. The exact tech you need. Comin' your way almost served on a silver platter.
Intel on the convoy - where'd you get it?
OK. I'm in.
Ridin' with you.
Nobody's gonna notice you gone, back at camp?
Your sour faces wouldn't help much.
And the Raffens - what about them? Expectin' any trouble?
How's that not right?
You don't miss life in Night City?
Yeah, took adjustment on my part, too. Though, never was completely alone.
A true friend. Jackie, by name. You would liked him, actually.
Plan to move this thing how exactly?
Tower looks inactive to me, too.
Any of this goes south, you know Panam'll be the one to pay.
You didn't take her side last time when she left the clan - why?
You thinkin' she learned somethin', she's smarter?
Nope. Just here to talk.
Panam asked me for help.
Need a hand?
'Member when we first met? Almost had a pound in your pants at the thought of falling foul of Saul.
Now you're gonna stick it to 'im plain. Something change?
How's it goin' over here?
Capacitor's damaged. Third from the right.
Got a little help from yours truly.
Mh, junctions.
Free? Like you could set off on a thousand journeys all at once?
Sure thing. Nothin' here.
Some sorta stone-age control panel.
Not here. Hm. Well, well, well. Got somethin'.
Here goes nothin’...
What'd you wanna talk about?
'Cause it's important to you.
So far, so good, champ.
Uh-huh, noticed.
Why's it any different with me?
Try followin’ the impulse next time.
Convoy - got eyes and ears on it?  Agh, shit....
You worried about Saul?
Oughta raise a glass to Scorpion.
Don't talk about the war much.
Uh-huh. But you all can't wait to pack your asses into the Basilisk, huh?
Gonna try and get some sleep.
Grown kinda cold out here.
Catch some shut-eye with me?
That another area of your expertise? Got maps of the heavens in your library, too?
Uh, yeeaah...?
Well, fuck me...
Sure did.
Got quite a pair o’ lungs, there.
Seem still to be in fine working order. Everything OK?
You need me again, all you gotta do is call.
Be waiting. Take care.
Sure! Be there soon.
So I hear.
All ready to go?
Corpos haven't shown up in person to report the loss?
And Saul - what about him?
So he's not planning a family council?
Always wanted to take one these suckers for a spin.
Got a bad feeling about this....
Nice and cozy in here.
What, no knobs, buttons, blinky doo dads?
Ever piloted anything like this?
Can I still get out?
Then I trust you.
Then I thrust you. If it's so mystical and shit, why the co-pilot? Extra support?
Doesn't need two pilots?
Panam...? Is this, uh... as designed?
OK. Stortin to understand what you meant.
Soft ride, seems a boat.
All right.
What's on the menu?
Mhm.
What's happening?
Right, Basilisk pilots workin' in harmony. That why I'm feelin' everything doubled?
OK. I could go for that.
Uhm. Yeah. Honestly, uh, no idea how people can focus in combat.
Was pretty close.
Hey come on.
Heh, good to know.
Beer me.
Speaking of happy endings... Back there, in the Basilisk, I... I hope you don't regret what happened.
Guess we'll have to do something about that.
Panam, what're you--
It's really not that simple.
That's the problem. What I want right now - doesn't mean a thing.
I'll think it all over, I pro--
Panam… I...
Where... where are we?
Where...?
Panam, I... It's getting worse, every single day...
To tell you the whole truth... I'm afraid things won't be the same between us if I do.
You know Johnny Silverhand?
That's just it. Johnny's alive. He's sitting in my head.
Long story. Got a Job, fucked it up, now Silverhand's personality construct sitting in my head.
Yeah, well, he's not too happy about it either. Turns out we don't really mix. And it's getting worse.
Just trying to live with it. Survive, actually.
I gotta go. I'm feeling better, really.
Hey, Mitch.
Much better now. Thanks for your help.
See you made yourselves at home already.
Thanks, I'll stick around for a bit.
You really safe here, though?
Remember Hellman? He's the one who created the personality construct tech.
But it was a dead end. Now I have to figure out where to go next. Couldn't help me. Not sure anyone can.
Thanks for everything. For being here for me.
Huh, yeah, respect. A feat in itself from what I've seen of the place.
Were you and Evelyn close?
Come here 'cause you want payback for what happened to er?
So, changed your mind, huh? Quickly, too.
All right, chill. I'm not here to squabble with yo.
Judy convinced you. Call me satisfied.
Solo skills don't lie in just executing movements. There's split second processes that happen - logistics, decision-making. Result of years of practice. Doubt your chip's capable of compensating for that.
Tech that's all pros and no cons? I don't buy it. Side effects, spill 'em.
And that's it?
How'd you ever come up with this?
All right... gotta see it to believe it.
Gotta admit - not bad.
What the... Argh!
Nice work, Judy. Outdid yourself. If you were to sell that, heh. You'd be the richest Judy in the NUSA.
If you got something to say, just say it.
Hehh... happy now?
Hiromi Sato? Who's that?
Where do we find this Hiromi?
Tom and Roxanne gonna come with?
Wouldn't it be better to ambush him on the street, like, while he's chomping on a scopdog or takin' a piss in a back alley? Why even try breakin' into a penthouse? It's probably crawlin' with guards.
Rather not have to flatline anyone.
Count me in, Judy. I already said I'd help, didn't I?
Agh, shit....
Judy... for real? No, don't wanna hear it.
Ep-ep-ep! Not a word.
Aaaargghh....
Ughhh... OK... OK, I'm better, I'm fine.
It's passed. Forget about it.
Sounds great, thanks.
Oh. Interesting.
Then I guess you should feel right at home.
That all you have to say?
Didn't know she dabbled in robotics.
After a day's work of tuning hardcore smut? Wouldn't be surprised.
First three are collectors' items nowadays... Someone likes getting their feet wet.
Who woulda thought.
So glad you came.
You nervous, Tom?
First time you've done anything like this. Just imagine you're doing what a doll does, just... different program. You're great at that. Any idea how I can get to Hiromi?
And Maiko, where's she?
All right. We goin' in?
What then? Everyone all in position?
Ya not comin' with me?
You gonna breach security, get me in the penthouse? Thought I could do it, but... Sorry, it's not gonna happen. Gotta manage on your own.
OK, on my way.
All right, on the roof.
Not all girls have to be nice, Johnny. 'Sides, she's gotta deal with a gang, she shouldn't be.  Could've called off the odds you know. Would've been quicker, simpler
You don’t have authority “yet”? Heh, you sound damn sure of yourself.
What're they watching?
Where the other two?
This is not what we agreed.
Maiko...
Maiko, our plan made no allowance for witnesses.
Meaning you wanna replace Hiromi.
Even if that means joining the Tyger Claws?
Don't like this one bit.
Do your thing.
Hold on, Maiko. I think you're gettin' carried away.
Bored of all this chatter. I'd rather we just cut to the quick.
What might that be?
We can't know that for sure. Maybe the lives we cut short'll be enough for the Claws. They do profit and loss better than Militech's CEO. They'll see it's not worth it. They wiped their hands of the Mox, maybe... Clouds is due its freedom now. Time to let it go, Maiko.
Ah, don't be dramatic, Judy. There's a difference between bein' a gonk and believin' people wanna do good.
See you around, Judy.
Hey, Jude. What's up?
I got good days, got bad days. Same as ever. You, uh, call just to see how I'm doin', or...?
Ask away. It's never boring with you.
No chance in your company. But now that we've blown each other, what's up?
Gotta say, I am intrigued... Why the wetsuit?
You really know how to reel me in, don't ya?
All right then, count me in. But I gotta warn ya - I look great in a wetsuit.
Uh, sure, what about it?
OK. Uh... Is this a date?
After all that went down thought you and I'd be ancient history.
Any news from the Moxes? Events, ideas?
How come?
So what's the latest from Clouds? Know anything?
Doesn't sound like it's all OK...
Somethin' got you down all of the sudden?
Judy...
So... ready to tell me what we're doing here?
How does one marry two separate neural tracks?
Must've gotten tangled up - interference, white noise...
So you load 'em onto separate neural tracks - no emo bogeys. Not bad. What do I gotta do?
That's it?
Sounds like we could do this anywhere. Why did we come all the way out here? What is this place?
And that's where we're gonna scroll?
Why would you say that?
You're more'n welcome to stay on shore.  Hell yeah, I'm in!
Look pretty damn fine in that wetsuit.
Water's toxic. That not a problem?
Haven't even asked me if I know how to swim. Not worried I'll just sink to the bottom like a bag of rocks?
All right, let's do this. Freezin'-ass water - here I come!
Where we headed, exactly?
Nah, why bother. I'll just stick close to you.
Virtus are more to you than just a way to churn out eddies, huh?
Generally how any kind of creativity works, sure.
But... I hear you just fine.
Hey, I know that! Etta Sorrentino - "Only You."
What now?
Down we go!
You wanna explore all that?
Yeah... I remember. NC Dam Ltd. made plans to build a dam. People protested, and the rest is history. Houses, playgrounds - all flooded. Got some connection to this place, right?
Why're you showing me this?
Why's this stand to be perfect?
Whatever you wanna do, Judy. Guess I'm with you.
Why didn't you come earlier?
Looks like this fell off your “one and only” eatery.
You know what they say - It ain't Caliente if it don’t burn on the way in... and out. Got somethin' here... Looks like an old photo cam.
You like it?
That's a weird place for a framed picture.
Nah, not much.
Hockey stick? Was there a skating rink here?
Here, take this camera, Better off in your hands than sittin' here, collectin' algae.
What about your parents?
What was that? Those voices...?
What was it like - livin' with your grandparents? How were they?
Temperamental, huh? Explains a lot. Is that a dominant family trait?
Where'd your grandparents go? Night City?
Let's keep goin', Judy.
We lookin' for anything in particular here?
Hard to imagine anything that could be more out of place in an underwater world.
Heh... Touché, Judy, touché. Gotta say, I don't really get why they left their wheels behind when they had to evacuate.
What, this isn't yours?
So it is yours.
You took her doll?
You hid it? Why?
Wanna see what's further on.
Where you used to run as a kid. Where daily life grinded along. Can imagine it a bit.
I don't know how it's possible, but... I think I hear those bells too.
Could look for another way inside.
Did you like goin' to this church?
Did it achieve anything?
I found an opening. I think we're safe to go through here.
Y-ya didn't get... chased off?
Agarrghhh!
What happened...?
How'd you manage to lift me out?
So, you're sayin'... you saved my life. Thank you.
You heard that...? S'incredible. Never happened before... But no worries, it's... Johnny Silverhand's construct. You heard his thoughts, not mine.
You remember the Relic? The reason for the whole damn heist... Well, Johnny Silverhand's digitized psyche was on it, and well... his personality's seepin' into my mind, taking over. You could say his mind's overwriting mine.
I got an idea, a plan, but... I just don't know if it'll... well, work.
Stay... where, exactly? We gonna camp on the shore?
Why the hell... not? Who's cottage is that, then? You said you knew the owner.
Uh, black, please.
A generator? Heh... what's next - jacuzzi? Finnish sauna?
I can turn it on.
Promise to take it slow.
Think you could've fine-tuned the emotive wave transmitters better back there. Feed I was pickin' up felt a bit... flat - I wanna say?
Power's up!
Your little spa's open for business.
Judy...? What was that? Couldn't hear you clearly. Somethin' the matter?
Don't bullshit me, Judy. We're still synced, remember?
Why would you even assume I'd think that?
Judy pisses you off - why? 'Cause she cares about people? And that reminds you you're a narcissistic asshole?
She reminds you of Alt, doesn't she?
You fuckin' blow if you can. Not about to leave her alone, middle of nowhere.
Mornin'.
Look. Night City's not for everyone. I grew up here, thought nothin' could surprise me...
I'd pack up my shit and bail too, if I could... But... it's just not the right time.
Why? What for?
Whoa... Askin' me to move in?
Dunno what to say... Nobody's ever done anything like this for me. Really shows trust.
This really it? Last time we see each other didn't seem so set on leaving just a sec ago.
I'll see ya, Judy.
He's got the gift of the gab, can't be denied, but I need to steal your buddy for a sec.
Hate to interrupt, but...
Why? What're we doin' here?
Goro. Good to see you.
What's in it for Yorinobu? Doesn't seem like the kind who'd care to honor tradition.
What message'd that be?
Not one for subtlety, is he? Still don't see how this gets us anywhere.
Still don't see how this gets us anywhere.
Get there how?
And how ya aim to manage that?
You're gnatshit crazy. In front of a crowd? What about security or...?
Expectation's way too high, Goro. Couldn't pull that off even if you still had your fancy implants.
Right. Then what?
Gotta be honest. Netrunning's not my forte.
Lots of ways to skin this particular cat, y'know. Gonna need--
Where'd you get this shard?
Kabuki? Might actually be half-decent soft, then. And if it isn't, got a few tricks up my sleeve, too.
Sounds like a plan.
Yeah, well - gettin' more'n'more used to that.
Think I see where this is goin'. Got me doin' all the dirty work.
Uh-huh. And in the meantime you'll do what? Crack open a can o' sud?
It fuckin' worked!
Done. System's ours.
Two-bit thief, ain't I? Keep sayin' so yourself.
Chill, Johnny. He's "'Saka scum" to you, but Goro's not a bad guy.
He's not on his A game, sure. But even without implants he could decomish us easily.
Nah. Just know... from the way he walks, look in his eye...
Forgot five - Oda zeroes us and pisses on our corpses. He won't ever be less than a foot away from Hanako.
What about me?
This your elaborate seppuku ritual?
Far as I can see, you're tryna get us killed. Really like to know why.
Well, sounds like a suicide run, but done dumber shit than this so...
Nope. Dumber yet, no. Set the bar pretty high with that one...
You're a stranger in a strange land. Goin' with you.
Yeah, got enough on my plate as it is. I'll let you handle that.
In the flesh.
And they…
Got factions inside Arasaka? What are they?
Tell me about 'em some other time.
Where's Yorinobu's rebellious streak come from?
Why'd Saburo tolerate it all? Can't get my head around it. Coulda kept his son on a short leash.
For Yorinobu.
Feels like that's about to change. Long as we get Hanako to believe our version of events... Conscience could also come into play. Assuming she's got one.
Wait... ya think she's complicit in Saburo's murder?
Sure, why not.
If?
Hate Night City that much?
Oh, can you run and grab us a pizza?
Saburo Arasaka with a protein bar? Get outta here....
Let's do this.
Got eyes on the comms system. S' lotta guards.
Armored door. Sealed tight.
Footbridge, but it's guarded.
Someone's stepped in quicksand, has serious trouble.
Antenna - security hub's liable to be in that building.
Transformer by the wall - see it?
Camouflaged turrets by the gate.
Looks like a service tunnel by the road there.
Pipes. See 'em?
Trucks drive up regularly.

Think I've seen everything...
Alright, quit moanin'. I'll give it another glance.
So? We goin' in?
Sounds sensible. Better get comfy.
Khe-khe-khe...
What?
Fine-lookin' feline. Thought they'd all disappeared from the city.
So? Cat like any other.
First it was birds, then dogs - cats actually put up a fight longest.
A “bakeneko?” What's that?
Believe in ghosts?
Chill - just a cat.
Feline ghost? Ah, suppose anything's possible.
Miss home?
Where'd you grow up, anyway?
Childhood memories, let's see... Hoppin’ buildings, runnin' away from badges. Iron taste of blood from a split lip...
My childhood, let's see... Nights spent lookin' for a star – any star… All dimmed by city lights. Silent lullabies sung by the flickering neon signs of Charter Hill…
Childhood memories, let's see... My childhood, let's see... Racin' my bobber for the first time through the hills… Oh, and uh, first kiss in the middle of a synth-cornfield…
Growin' up in Chiba-11 - what was it like?
Transporters, you say.
Lemme guess - so they could turn 'em into corposoldiers?
So how's a corpo rookie go from cleanin' latrines to bein' Saburo Arasaka's bodyguard?
You're not sayin' Saburo fell for you at first sight.
And all you had to do in return was kill Saburo's enemies.
Did what you had to to keep from goin' hungry.
Sayin' you got no dirt on your hands?
Forgetting I was at Arasaka? Saw how corps operate – wasn't roses and rainbows.
So spill - how'd you sully yours?
Slavin' away for a corp - not exactly everybody's dream.
Least I'm not fleecin' this planet and its people in the name of profit-margins!
C'mon, not everybody wants to change the world.
Wasn't judging you.
Take a look around. It's here - your corporate world in its glorious splendor.
And Chiba-11's slumrats? They're there, scraping scrops out of scoptins... Corps decided that, too.
Tired of bickerin'. Let's just drop it.
You already forget what happened at Tom's Diner? People hate corps more than anything. Can't blame 'em, elther. Got some regrets, but kleppin' from Arasaka ain't one of 'em.
Never too late to change.
Nomads aren'T lone wolves with egos. Whether they're blood or not - family comes first.
What's that?
Don't be smart, got no idea what I feel.
Finally startin' to make some sense.
The bakeneko got sick of us, looks like.
Fuck... gettin' worse...
About Jack? What is it?
For the life of me, can't figure why. So his mom couldn't give him a proper sendoff?
What're you talkin' about?
[That's bullshit.] Don't believe it. Pure bullshit.
Jackie's psyche – where're are they keepin' it?
Why'm I only hearin' this now?
Selfies count as recon now?
It worked. Can hear it in your voice.
How'd your recon go?
Uh, how?
I'm in.
That's why I'm here.
OK, I'm in.
Gotcha. How's things at your end?
OK, float's ours to do with as we please. You can fly it to Tokyo if you want.
It fuckin' worked!
OK, what now?
As if I wasn't in enough already...
Where'll it be this time? Trash processing plant? Deserted NCART station?
Hey, Goro. Wow, you look like a million eddies.
A-hah. Wow, what'd you think? Tasty?
Aw, Goro? If you're here to jump, remember that there's help available. There's a 'round-the-clock hotline...
Wait. If things go to shit, we got a backup plan?
Plan's fucked beyond all recognition, yet here I am.
Ah, thank me once it works. Now get into position.
I'm ready. Question is, are you?
All the while ignoring one crucial element - your “friend” Oda.
Maybe. But you're gonna be droppin' in on Hanako by surprise.
So?
Stay safe, Goro.
OK, good to go.
Won't know what hit 'im.
Goro? I took out the one closer.
Guy who killed you, right?
Chill out a sec. Sure it was him?
You're glad?
You gotta be satisfied? You got fuck-all to lose!
Fuck! Almost fell.
What do soldiers say? Target down.
Keep you posted.
Welp, that'll be all.
And that is?
OK, on my way.
Shit... Not good...
Been on a while. Time for a break.
Fuck! Course you're here!
I... I managed to...
He's breathin... For now...
You and your fuckin' sick sense of honor... Today's your lucky day, though. Can thank your old friend, Goro.
I'm sorry, Oda.
Brought this on yourself, too...
He'd have done the same to me. You saw it!
Had to. Can't just go around leavin' loose ends. They come back, sting you in the ass, string you up by the neck.
OK, preem. Online and in the system.
Hanako's inside.
Tryna call someone, I think.
Goro? All systems jammed. It's now or never.
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Whatever he did, now we're really fucked!
Yeah... for now! Lost your fuckin' mind?!
Where are you?
Now're you gonna tell me what the fuck you were thinkin’?!
Right about now, Hanako's the most famous missing person in the world...
So every Arasaka soldier is on our trail.
You kidnap Hanako Arasaka and offer her a cup of fuckin' tea?!
I'm sorry that we have to speak under such... circumstances.
I was there that night at Konpeki Plaza, I saw Saburo Arasaka die. He wasn't poisoned. That's a lie your brother made up and spread. Yorinobu is the murderer.
Yorinobu's the murderer. He strangled your father. I saw it with my own eyes.
Why? My word mean shit to you?
Oh, shut up, Goro! Was s'posed to be honest. Well, that's what I'm bein'! Fine, maybe I am just a two-bit thief... but I'm the two-bit thief that stole that fuckin' Relic off you. Slotted it in, took a bullet to the brain, died...
Oh yeah. And now I got Johnny fuckin' Silverhand in there, and I'll do anything to get him out. So I got exactly nothin' to lose. But you got lots.
Look, I know it's a lot to take in, let alone believe. Also know you're an honorable person, worthy of trust. And that's why I wanna make you an offer.
The relic your brother tried to hawk off on Netwatch is in my head. Right now. Took a bullet to the brain, but the tech on the chip saved me. Now it's slowly killin' me. One of your personality constructs, engrams. It's overwriting my psyche. Gotta stop the process before it's too late. I know you got the means to help me.
Thing is, I'm damned determined and got nothin' to lose.
Got your prototype Relic jammed in my head. By freak coincidence it stopped, then helped me survive, a billet. Now it's slowly killin' me. One of your personality engrams is overwriting itself on my psyche, and if I don't find a way to stop it... well, it won't end well for me.
"Mad"? Got no idea, lady. See, I got a voice in my head. An engram, one of your personality constructs.
Yeah. I stole the relic Yorinobu tried to peddle off on NetWatch. While Iw as makin' my escape, got a bullet to the brain... Relic saved me. Now the damn thing's killin' me. And I gotta stop it.
I got a bad feelin' about this...
Dammit!
Thank me later! Need to find a way out now - fast!
Oh shit...
Really?! Think so?!
Yep, just two fuckin' losers. And I thought we were screwed when Goro kidnapped Hanako.
Johnny?
Shut your gonk mouth. Please. Sayin' random shit ain't gonna help anyone.
Johnny, for cryin' out--
And if it's Goro?
He's a big boy, I'm sure he'll pull through.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Saw him yourself. Even ‘thout his implants, he was a good fighter. He'll pull through.
Car.
Who's there?!
I said, who's there!
I'm armed. Don't try anything.
Alright - gonna let you in.
Yeah. Knocked the last star off this dump. So? You were saying? Got a message?
What'll start?
Or a proxy.
Hanako...? That you?
Any word from Goro? We split up when we went on the run.
How'd you find me?
Damn shame you didn't believe me earlier. Goro might've still been alive had you.
Fine.
OK, so now that you know, and believe - what's next?
I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you, painful.
Decided already, is that it? You're in no position to set conditions.
Have to send a swarm of proxies to do that. This here, talkin', is because you're alone. You don't have anyone else you can turn to.
You're gonna help me first.
Well I'm pretty tight on time, too. Dyin', in fact. My dead body'd make for a pretty lame-ass witness.
Wanna know everything you know about Mikoshi.
Try a prison?
Tracked down your runaway. Hellman was hidin' under Kang Tao's wing. We chatted. Thinks sooner or later the engram'll completely consume me. Process can't be stopped.
At the very least, I got my hands on the Relic's schematics. Got detailed information about its inner workings, project tech documentation...
All I know about constructs is that one of them's out to kill me. I got no idea how it wound up on the Relic... or how to remove it.
Me? That's Arasaka tech.
Managed to make contact with Alt Cunningham.
The very same who invented Soulkiller. Using her modified version now.
That's about the extent of what we got. What now?
What?
Got what we wanted. Don't tell me that proxy got to you?
C'mon, think about it. Yesterday Hanako was living in a world that was completely safe for her. What's she got on her hands now? A foreign city, a homicidal brother and a fuckin' thief. It's why she sent a proxy. She's alone. And she's shittin' herself more than we are.
What? Did you say "clink"?
Right. 'Cause at least we've dealt with 'Saka henchmen before. But this? It's somethin' new.
Glad you're in one piece.
Not sure how you want me to interpret that.
Don't know yet.
I'm sticking to the plan. Hanako at my back will be a big help.
Any idea what's going on at Arasaka?
Where are you right now?
That's hardly an answer.
Gee, thanks.
Won't press you on details.
Parade - how's the prep going?
Never pegged you as the paranoid type.
Right. In other news...
Your hideout's been blown. Probably literally. Where are you now?
Spoke with her. Not In person, but we spoke. You know who I'm talking about.
Hard to believe, but it's true.
No way of knowin' for sure. All we have's her word.
Hard for me to trust anyone who goes via proxies.
Seem to know everything already. I gotta keep talkin'?
Not too helpful so far. Gotta find Soulkiller first, 'cause Hanako - and I quote - her hands are tied.
Yep, like Soulkiller's just something I could go pick up in Kabuki.
Got a meet in person, soon.
Gonna be there, too?
How's Oda doing? Still on the mend?
Talk to you later.
What's up? Got a few more words 'bout the... "porcelain cunt?"
Uugh! Johnny!
Johnny...
Almost flatlined by that attack.
You're right, hard to take my eyes off it. We in, uh... Pacifica? What's this building?
Saw the pseudoendotrizine in your hand.
I gotcha - no talkin' your way outta this one. You wanted to pop the pill.
Oh fuck off, I know what you are.
Think I woke up, derailed your plan in the nick of time.
These yours?
Huh, fifty years back... Mexican conflict?
So, that the truth you decided to reveal in song?
Egh. I wouldn't mind lyin' down right now, watchin' a fan till the end of time...
Why you givin' me these?
Dumbass question...
I would, yeah.
I... I'd do the same for you.
Got a better idea?
Well?
Seriously? Smasher? He suddenly comes to mind?
Last time we saw him, we--
That your dyin' wish - revenge?
That ain't true. Not sure it's somethin' Rogue would bother with these days. She delegates. Why stick her neck out for this, or at all?
I'm not at all excited about this plan - realize that, right?
Not sure you've earned my trust.
Don't even enjoy control over myself.
Rogue's convenient cover.
Or some gonk ass suicide plan to attack Arasaka again. Know you pretty damn well at this point, Johnny.
Hellman said you'd do this - make a power grab or pitch for control.
May not help, but he doesn't hurt me. Need to know exactly what you plan to do.
"Hey, Satan kicked me outta hell, thought I'd swing by."
Need to think it over.
Feelin' better. Should get goin'.
Doubt that's ever goin' away.
The Hotel Pistis Sophia - that right?
Just not today. Ugh...
You gonna strum her guilt, squeeze her for favors. Remind her all about how she left you to die in 'Saka Tower.
Heh. What, ya gonna use your charm?
OK, one more time - you're just gonna talk to Rogue about Smasher, right?Then you'll hand me the wheel and hop back in the passenger seat.
Actually, regretting this already.
OK, I'm ready.
'Bout fuckin' time.
Mhm... Ugh.
Mhm… Ugh
Talk about smething else, please?
Did we, uh...? You know...
You don't seem surprised.
I got flashes here an' there. Not everything, thank God.
Ugh, feel like shit.
Come to see for yourself, huh? Morbid curiosity?
Feels weird, this… you knowin' about Johnny.
I don't smoke.
Smasher - he tell you about 'im?
Know what Smasher's been up to all this time?
Can I help at all?
OK.
Fuck, never again.
Maybe wouldn't be bad if you hadn't chased 'em down with fuck knows what.
You tricked me. Just supposed to talk to Rogue.
You oughta be the one pukin' right now.
And the stripper? Empathy brawl? Tattoo?
"Ebunike"? A lead on Grayson's supposed to be a lead on Smasher? Lead to lead - that's real?
Coulda done all that myself. [TBD]
The hell is this place?
So why're these docks called "Ebunike"? Pretty sure it's got nothin' to do with some long-dead mayor.
Meanin' you found Grayson? He really got an in with Smasher?
OK.
I got somethin' I gotta do first.
Weyland? Of THE Weylands?
Like everybody in this town.
Ya gonna be joining us?
Let's go.
How'd Weyland help you, exactly?
So we know where to look for him.
Is this Johnny's jacket? With me wearin' it, you sure you won't confuse us?
Thanks.
I got somethin' I gotta do first.
Weyland? Of THE Weylands?
Like everybody in this town.
Ya gonna be joining us?
Let's go.
How'd Weyland help you, exactly?
So we know where to look for him.
Is this Johnny's jacket? With me wearin' it, you sure you won't confuse us?
Thanks.
Oh, Johnny talks about himself, mostly.
Said you're the best. Always were…
Any idea what Grayson's got planned? Weyland tell you anything?
Ya sure you're up for this?
No. Just… I don't wanna see Johnny haze you. Adam Smasher's his obsession, not yours.
Just tryin' to play fair.
It's a little weird you didn't run into Smasher before now.
Yeah, but, y-you never tried to track him down?
OK, sure. Believe me, I know.
So what's our plan?
Smasher.
You know where their dataterm is? How, exactly?
Didn't know you worked for Maelstrom.
OK. We can start.

And in the meantime, we do what?
OK.
Looks like they're hidin' out on the ship.
Not lookin' so hot.
Kinda hard to believe he's got his hidey-hole here.
OK.
Why're you even doin' this?
Avengin' Johnny?
Oh, interesting.
Ya sure it was this exact merch?
Recordings, seem like to me.
Yeah, can give it a shot.
Grayson might've. To have dirt on Smasher.
Grayson. Yeah.
It's not yours, I don't think.
Nice an' easy, or I'll pop another in ya.
I'd start talkin' if I were you. Your wound looks pizza-wreck awful, an' I don't see no one around who could help.

Could crack your skall like an eggshell know that? You'd still be able to talk. For a little while.
What's he goin' on about?
Where's Smasher now?
When's he due back?

Gonna lead us to Smasher, assface.
I'm not. Interested in Silverhand. And what happened to him.
Silverhand's iron - you had it.
Smasher ever tell you what he did with Silverhand's body?
What did they do with 'im?
He deserve extinction? Do I end him?
How'd Smasher wind up with Johnny's stuff?
Don't want a damn thing from you.
Don't want a damn thing from you.
[TBD]
Johnny says you'll get him yet.
To Johnny, this is more than a 50-year-old grudge.
It's about you. He wanted to do this with you.

Smasher...
OK, I get that.
Let's see what we got here...
OK.
It's better than the junkyard where I landed.
What'd you expect? Headstone flag and flowers?
Really need symbolic, empty gestures?
And how do you feel?
We'll figure something out.
Better now?
"Night City Legend."
What's gotten into you? Where's Johnny I'm the fucking greatest Silverhand? Don't even recognize you.
It's been a long, bumpy road, but we made it.
It's too bad we didn't talk like this earlier. Woulda made things easier.
Remember you whinin' for smokes in the middle of the night? Complainin' about bein' able to kill me.
When you said you let your friends down - did ya mean Rogue?
Not dif's lost yet, least with Rogue.
Smasher biz really got to her. Ya can't leave it like this, I don't think.
You oughta talk to her.
Good idea.
Yeah, I'll call her.
Worth comin' out all the same?
Johnny wants to ask you out on a date. Whaddaya think?
Where’d you wanna go?
OK. I’ll swing by the Afterlife pick you up.
Hey, Rogue. Ready?
We goin'?
You look... wow.
He'll join us later.
That's what was in the container, the one Grayson was talking about.
Silver Pixel Cloud your favorite place?
Sounds like a preem place for a date.
So it wasn't his idea.
Meaning?
Johnny's changed. He really does wanna spend some time with ya. No hooks, no lines, no sinkers.
Rogue?
Can't stop us, won't stop us. We asked you out on a date.
OK, gotta be the pass, this. Guess we really are going to the movies.
All right, let's go.
Sure thing.
Oh. Interesting.
'Bout to see.
Looks like a spurt of runny shit.
"Bushido" will give you that.
Have fun, you crazy kids.
Uhhh... Rogue's gone.
You fought - what about.
Any guesses?
Weird's not the word, I don't think. He was toying with 'er. Could be something to that.
That s'posed to help you figure out Rogue?
Well? So why're we here, exactly?
Where'd you hear anything about Kerry?
Mhm, your big night out. So what, wanna pay him a visit?
So I gotta hit Kerry's digs, look around, critique the drapes?
What, really worried he wants to hurt himself?
Meanin' you wanna go in person? Gotta hand you the reins again?
Heh uh-huh. First Rogue, now Kerry, Who's next on the list of conjugal visits?
What was that about attempted suicide?
Could just be the rumor mill.
OK. But I wanna know what you plan to do.
How you plan to tell him it's you? Could be dealin' with some real personal shit right now, might not be the best time to mess with his head.
OK. Just lemme know when you wanna take the wheel.
Wicked bad collection.
Axe like that run us many eddies?
Looks like he's showering?
OK.
No.
You two have fun at least?
The hell is this concert thing?
Gets sharper as the pills wear off. So?
What if this ends up like the Rogue thing - one big let down?
OK. Callin' Nancy.
Nancy? I mean - Bes? Bes Isis?
Wanna talk to Bes.
Callin' from Kerry Eurodyne's residence.
What was Nancy like, back in the day?
Not much left to clean up, probably.
Lookin' for Bes Isis.
Sure did. Why, you got another one? Had to toss the first.
You the one in charge now?
What happened to Royce?
Bes Isis - mean anything to you?
No, just gotta talk. Heard she's here.
Seems like you all come out ahead, then.
What, that'd disappoint you?
Looks like I'm interrupting.
Should up your huscle on the "Ebunike." Just there the other day - your people didn't put up much of a fight.
Heheh, chill, just some friendly advice.
Seems your people're goldin' a grudge.
Kerry Eurodyne sent me. With some biz for Bes.
'Preciate it. Thanks.
Brick seems all right.
That's what you wanted to talk to him about?
So, what - giving up on your story? I won't learn anything about Maelstrom's music?
You got some sorta in with them?
One more word about him and I stamp you out like a roach, got it?
Pretty loud in here. You renovatin'?
Royce, eye. Ha ha. You a fan of your little gang group, too?
Got it.
Where'd you get your chompers done?
If I say the "before" was better, will ya take 'em off?
Want the same - twinsies?
Lookin' for Bes Isis, N54 News. Know she's here.
Oh, I'll do the bothering. Lead the way.
Royce remember me fondly?
Royce and Bes gettin' on all right?
How'd she get him to agree to talk?
Maybe one more question from Bes?
Went for a cruise on the "Ebunike" the other day. Your turf, right?
Seemed a little busy. Might wanna think about a better system than an old Athena III.
Didn't have you pegged for a music geek.
Got some biz with Bes.
Kerry Eurodyne sent me.
Doesn't seem to me like you're in any danger. Gang seems... friendly enough towards you.
Whadda they mean by scan?
But you came here to do a music fluff piece.
What, exactly?
How'd you plan to get outta this before I showed up?
We're leaving. Not goin' quietly, either. Try not to catch any lead on the way out.
Want that data out or not?
Lemme copy the data and get it out.
Not about to do anything to draw any notice.
Got it. Delete yours, then try and distract 'em. I'll sneak out.
Huh, classic.
Had time, knows the place.

Yep, send you the files in a sec.
You still in touch with anyone 'sides Kerry?
Was asking about Samurai.
Coulda been worse. This way you got a souvenir.
Wants to bring back Samurai - one gig, one night.
Gonna be a gig in Silverhand's honor.
A reunion with some old friends?
So whaddaya want? An interview with Kerry?
Not a problem, not as far as I can see.
Alright. So… the concert?
OK. Thanks.
Yep. She agreed, even said she'd organize the gig.
Ran into a few hiccups with the good folk from Maelstrom...
What, me too? Why?
What happened here?
This supposed to be Henry's surprise?
So he flooded the pool with concrete?
Know what happened between them?
I imagine that wasn't too hard in his state of mind, either out of it or in rehab.
What about the concert?
Not really my biz...
Kerry sent me. It's about the concert.
Look, it's awkward. Kerry considers you both friends.
We're bringin’ back Samurai - one night only.
Maybe if someone'd tell me what happened...
Maybe he had a good reason.
You outta your fuckin' mind with the pool? You knew Kerry wanted to get Denny to play with us.
Gotta go without one or the other.
Pretty sure it's your call.
Thanks, real helpful.
If we gotta choose, let's play with Denny.

Everything OK?
So his fault after all?
Well, pretty sure she knew Henry wanted this concert.
Talked to Kerry? Didn't change his mind or anything?
What about Henry? Still not on board?
DeLuze Orphean. ‘Member that Samurai graffiti in Heywood where the bakery used to be?
Where'd you find it? It's, like, fresh off the shelf.
How 'bout you tell me what happened with Henry.
You got tired of getting your hands dirty all the time?
So what happened next?
What'd you do?
How ya feelin' ahead of the show?
Hey, thanks for putting the gig together.
Silverhand was prolly the same.
Where's Kerry?
Right. Can't let that full house down.
Just strays. Kerry didn't want word to get around.
Yo think the media caught wind of this?
I'd worry more about Henry's replacement.
And? He any good?
And if I start puking blood again?
Got a feeling Nancy doesn't think I can keep up with 'em.
I dunno, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
It's getting worse. Maybe this gig isn't worth it?
OK, fine. You got me.  Have fun.
Ugh...
Yeah. Yeah, but he can still hear you.
How was the gig?
Damn shame I had to miss it.
You shouldn't have, really.
Meanin' you tried to shoot me.
Guess he had somewhere to be, badly.
Isn't that what you wanted? To make him feel better?
“Johnny, don't ever leave me again! I can't live without you”?
Hope that's it for last requests.
Gotta go talk to Hanako. Fast.
Let's go.
Kerry?
V this time. Disappointed?

Simple. Imagine that Johnny's along for the ride.
Whatever. In any case, I'm at the wheel, and rather keep it that way.
Something particular up, Kerry?
These your wheels?
So, what good'll my balls do us today?
Uh-huh. How's that, exactly?
All right, and you got a beef with these chicks because...?
Riiiight… so, what's the plan?
You got it.
What now?
Whoever's driving that truck - they armed, maybe? Got any huscle?
All right, just spit it out. This a set-up? Flock of medias about to fly in?
Automated modules, hollow spikes for better control of the vehicle - standard-issue police tech. 'Nades, too. Where'd you get 'em?
Black market?
Sure hope you know what you're doin'.

Get out. Nice and easy, no weirdness, nothing'll happen.
I said — easy. Now get down on the ground. Won't say it a third time.
Quit squirmin'. And no gonk moves.
Your lucky day, Ker. Crates 'n' crates of nothin' but gear.
Stuff's worth at least a couple hundred thou'. Really wanna trash it, not klep it?
Got your mixers, speakers, drums, cables by the mile.
You're the boss!

It's burnin' real nice, I'll grant ya that. Thing is, I mean, what's it actually get ya?

Wouldn't it've been better to have a lawyer fight this fight for ya?

Yet to see a single eddie.
Kerry Eurodyne eats at a dump like this?

Wow, coffee with a rock star… Eh, why not? First time for everything.
What he's havin'.


They really got to you, didn't they?

Not exaggerating, Ker? The girls just wanna have fun, sing your song. To millions of adoring fans. You stand to gain here too.
Don't believe for a millisec you torched that truck for art's sake. This is about money, isn't it? They screw you on the royalties?
Tell you this much - if they don't back out now, gimme a call. We'll convince 'em another way.
Somethin' tells me this isn't about Art-with-a-capital-A. Not about eds either. You're afraid, Kerry.
What's Johnny got to do with any of this?
But that's not true.

And that's not something you'll admit to.


Johnny's dead.
And you're alive. Decide whose truth matters more to you — yours or someone else's.
Only if you don't have the 'nads to answer it honestly.
Don't mention it.
Hi Kerry.
Wait, what? I thought we took care of it.
What now? Gonna plant a bomb in the club?
OK, good, 'cause I thought—

Tried talkin' to the label, didn't you?
Hey, so, what's the plan?

Yeah. Pretty sure you gave 'em enough already. Burning truck was everywhere — all the sheets, all the feeds.
Look, sometimes simplest is best — we just buy tickets.
Cool. We'll find a way in anyway.



Choom, come on, help us out. We left 'em inside.
Yeah, but by that time the holoprojectors'll be on and outta whack. I'll have to recalibrate, and no way this show starts on time.
Past life. Worked backstage for G-Hung for a time, learned some things. Finally came in handy today.

Past life. Worked backstage for G-Hung for a time, learned some things. Finally came in handy today.
Hear 'im out. This's all a misunderstanding - clear it up, and we're gone.
You will do what he says. Now. And then you'll forget he was ever here.
Wait, wait, wait. What's this about a deal?
OK, seems like you don't get it. Don't give a shit what you thought. There is no deal, and there will be no deal.
Looks like the label fucked you all. You're their pawns. They're playin' you.
Had enough of this fuckin' around! Tell 'em the concert's off now!

Hang on, let's get a selfie.
Yeah. Have fun.
Yeah. Have fun.
Well, what's the occasion?

Out of order for Kerry Eurodyne's guests, too? He's expecting me.
It's a wild and crazy ride.
But hey — can't complain.




You look great.


I'm a little busy at the moment, but I'll call you if I'm hard up.
Hey.
Let's see what you got.

Congrats, Ker. Decent show.
Now that that's behind us, what's Kerry Eurodyne's next mission? Hit on Kovachek?
You try to get outta that deal with the label?
You'd be free.
Should I feel special?


Glad we get this moment to ourselves.
What's up?
No truth to that?

Talk to me.
Again?
But you did make it. Big, too. Only diehards remember Samurai now. You — everybody knows your name.

It's time you stopped bein' afraid. You don't need to.

I'll even protect you from yourself.


Does it matter?
Moment's gonna pass, isn't it.
Let's delta. Chaos awaits.
OK. See ya.
Kerry, hey.
Say no more, on my way.



OK, yeah. Sounds promisin', I'm in.
That your song? Don't recognize it.
Nice axe.
Okay, so — lemme hear what this is all about.
Uh… breakfast cereal?
Your guru?
This, um, closure… s'got anything to do with Johnny? With you battling shadows?
Huh, think I know the feelin'.
I'll bite — tell me about these "loops."
What was that little number? I know it.
But actually it's…?
Ehh, and you need company for that?
And now?
Could just be what folks call "maturity."

Heh, chaos and destruction? Why the fuck not.
Jesus, Kerry! That's eddies down the drain!
An' no regrets after, ownin' a trashed yacht?
Whose the fuck is it?
Kovachek? THAT Kovachek?

OK, let's rip this boat to shreds!

Beautiful, isn't it?


Gotta admit, not bad.
To settle that score?



Pencil me in. And no countin' rounds.
'Course I do.

I know. I'll be careful.
Can you chill for two secs? We go in, we talk, we leave. That's it.
Let's step to it, then.
Thanks for meetin' me.
Weren't sure of anything - if you could trust me, if Yorinobu'd killed your father. Now…?
You… knew?
You knew but didn't do a thing about it. Why? Suddenly sprout conscience just yesterday?
Helped your brother cover up. Makes you no better than him, not a smidge.
[To 1]
Ties that bind.
[To 1]
Power.
The corporation.
No idea.
Huh, guess Yorinobu's instructions were a little different.
[To 1]
Mhm, he's your brother it's been hard. It'll be hard. Let's say I get that. But what changed your mind?
Yorinobu was just plain willin' to sacrifice you.
We were gonna talk Biz, specifics.
Seem on edge. Something got ya spooked?
Think someone mighta tailed you?
'Course I didn't bring Soulkiller. 'Fraid we don't know each other that well.
Take me for a fool, think I'd fall for that? Got plans to walk outta here alive.
Meanin’? Mikoshi don't exist in realspace.
Where?
Wanna leave?
Quit buttin' in so I can hear her out.
Shut up. For one goddamn minute, shut up!
Sure know how to prick up my ears. Go on. Talk.
And you'll help me in exchange for…?
Sounds like you want to avenge dead ol' dad.
Just say it. Be easier that way.
Still vague. You want him dead.
Hm, sounds like dirty laundry, a family matter. Why should I get involved?
Hmm…
How you plan to do this?
“Testify…” Listen, mind if I'm straight with you?
Want me to throw Yorinobu under the bus in front of Arasaka top brass? Call me crazy, but that sounds like fuckin' suicide.
Like, such as…?
Let's assume it works. Then what? You take the Arasaka throne?
Figured it as a given. Besides, Takemura said you were supposed to step in for Yorinobu here in Night City.
No wish to? Or no permission? You bein' a woman.
Sure, whatever. Your biz, not mine.
Offer's intriguing. Need to think about it.
Don't like this at all. Sounds like you wanna use me.
Not the first to try.
Yeah, i-it's just, uh…
Huh?
Fuck..
Agh… I'll think it over…
No worries… 'bout that…
W-what're you doin'?
Yeah, I get it. And don't like it one bit. I'm still goin' strong.
Yeah? How, exactly?
Don't stand a chance without help.
Maybe she'd have stuck her neck out for you and century ago. But now? I don't see it.
What about Panam? She offered help.
Hanako's offer's on the table.
Oh, cut the crap! She actually has power, could be our ticket.
Gotta stop you, dickhead. What's your scheme? This is my body, I make the calls.
Agh, Johnny…
Wha…? Am I…?
Wha…? Am I…?
Vik?
My head. Agh…
Ergh… feels like..
How… How'd I get here?
I, uh… Wasn't completely myself.

Just give it to me straight, Vik.
Order a weaker poison next time.
I'll try. I think I'm gettin' some feeling back.
OK, but don't expect a miracle…
Agh…
Heh… Another Viktory… for the history books.
If you got somethin' to say, Vik, just say it.
Well? Looks like I can sit up all right. But I can tell you don't have good news.
You tell me.
I know, Vik. I'll try. Soon.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I know. Thoughts on where to start?
“Take matters into my own hands”? The fuck you think I been doing?!
Yeah… What about it?
Enough, Johnny. I just-- I gotta think about it.
Give it a fuckin' rest, Johnny. It's my decision. An' I gotta think about it.
Uhh… out loud? What?
Egh… Think I can do it…
Say… who won the bout?
Did he get up? Walsh, was it?
Meanin'?
Why'd you get so mad, then, if you already knew who won?
Any theories?
Can't thank ya enough for all you've done, Vik.
Thanks, Vik, I will. An' you hang in there, too.
Shouldn't've had to. Sorry 'bout that.
Sure, Got a feelin' Vik's had enough of me as is.
And lemme guess - my aura's sputtering?
Sure, lead the way. Why's this spot special?
Jackie? What's he got to do with any of this?
Who, Jack?
Doesn't sound like the Jackie I knew.
Mhm.
Be alone with my thoughts? Near on unachievable these days…
Thanks, Misty. You were right, choice spot.
So what… what'd Jackie decide up here?
No, still here.
Worst case scenario - that what you expect?
Nah. Not really my style… goodbyes.
Mhm. then you tried to kill me.
You're the one who rejects the only option we got left.
Think it's worth takin' a chance on Arasaka.
Inherited your finest traits.
Just… hold on a minute - need to think.
I'm callin' Panam.
Just wanna hear her voice.
Won't keep you long. Just... wanted to hear ya.
Dunno that we'll see each other again.
No, no, not like that...
Somethin... Somethin' I gotta do today. Gonna be high risk, big time. But I have to.
It's not for comms, not really.
Yeah.
You don't get it, I... I can't wait anymore.
It does.
But--
Wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise.
Mhm. Then you tried to kill me.
Gonna try to ask Panam for help.
Gonna try this with Panam.
Could be my last ride, this. If it don't work out... Just wanna be there for it, aware. See you inside Mikoshi.
Johnny? 'Kay. Just me now.
Ready.
Need a way into Arasaka Tower. Now.
I'm serious. Whole thing with Johnny...? I don’t do something soon I'm done. Gone.
The tech. Underneath that tower they got an access point to, well, odd as it sounds, a prison of souls.
Ugh... Knew this might not fly over the holo. Mikoshi - that's Its name. Only place Johnny and I can disentangle for good. It's my last chance.
About the gist of it, yeah.
Wha-- OK?
Vik's clinic.
Give it shot, sure.
Like Vik said. Taken matters into my own hands.
Waitin' for my driver.
Sure, why not.
OK, I'm ready.
Heheh, what a surprise...
Sounds like Johnny.
OK, definitely Johnny. He is one great disturbance.
Hah, something that doesn't give me the chills, finally.
Uh-huh...
Huh? What, why?
I, uh... Heheh, ahem. No, I'm fine. OK. And Johnny's?
Well, it... doesn't sound too bad, right?
Yep. No mistakin' that ride, ever.
Didn't think anything could scare you.
You too, Misty. And thanks for everything.
What happened?
Where'd she go?
'Fraid I don't got a choice, Mitch.
They know why, what our aim is?
Been better. So, what've you guys patched together?
Sure these plans're up-to-date, completely reliable?
So you wanna tunnel into Arasaka Tower.
Construction site - whaddaya we got for security? Whole place spiked? Militech out in full force?
Mhm. What's a SERC?
Sounds doable in theory to me. No competing ideas, then let's get to prepping.
Hey, you and Panam - something I need to know about?
Panam think so too?
Yeah.'Least, I think so.
Need a decent net connection. Someone I know can help us get into Mikoshi.
Alt. She's-- It's… AI from... out past the Blackwall.
'Cause I'll ask it to, nicely.
Thanks, Saul.
Prep coming along all right?
Isn't this...?
Afterburner - standard nitro or military grade?
So hardware's military. But how the hell’d you cram all that into a panzer?
Firepower up top - what is it?
Where'd you get all this stuff?
Since tomorrow's the big day already, how about we take her for a spin now? Wanna get a feel for her over the terrain.
Hey, Saul sent me.
Need a strong rig for a little jaunt on the Net.
Gonna be hitting a masked, encrypted BBS. Prefer nobody knew I was there. Your tech up to it?
Heading for the wild frontier, Dakota.
Not at all curious what I'm goin' in for?
Ice-filled tub... favorite bit.
Carol. Here to help Dakota?
Can't say how long this is gonna take. Whatever happens, stay cool, all right?
Hello, Alt.
This place... changes every time. Feels like I'm... deeper. Can't tell if that's a good or bad thing.
Sayin’ the more I'm here the more I lose touch with the outside, with reality?
Johnny's currently indisposed.
Seemed to me you didn't care a lick about Johnny. That he ceased to exist for you, even.
Lemme get this straight. Mean to say you only agreed to help me cause of Johnny? And since he's not here this one time, you're thinkin' of backin' out?
Hmm, 'cause for a second you were displeased and I seemed a side note to all this.
This all just an experiment to you? Are we just fresh data to analyze, do what you want with?
Damn shame really. You were out to prove him wrong, here, in person. But all you got is me. Think there's still some old Alt Cunningham left in you after all.
Nah, Johnny's made his peace with my decision.
Need your help, Alt. Don't got a lotta time left.
Speak for yourself. Didn't you cheat death?
Your code, your consciousness... AIs live beyond reality's boundary, they live forever.
Why don't you swoop down on your chariot and enlighten me? Surely an all-powerful AI can handle that.
Hm. Guess that'd be... human of me?
What should I expect there - in Mikoshi?
And Johnny? What happens to him?
There anything we can know for certain?
Constructs imprisoned there - gonna set them free?
Constructs’Il be “integrated?” Mean you're gonna absorb 'em. Assimilate. No wonder you jumped at this chance. You wanna destroy Mikoshi, swallow all the psyches in there.
Not sure Johnny'd like the sound of that.
Huh, hardly. Doubt you'll first gab with those constructs, ask 'em what they think.
Wasting time talking. Let's just do this.
What's on the shard? A vectored virus?
Hope you haven't cooked up any surprises, Alt.
Should I look for a specific access point? Can already tell you ICE all the way to Tokyo'll be backing every single one.
What happened here?
Sorry about the damage...
Nothin' is all right, Carol. My mind, my body - it's goin' to pieces. If I don't get to Mikoshi, and fast...
The shard. Wrote some soft I need to one of the shards.
Thanks, Dakota.
On my way.
Saul! You wanted a word?
What's with the gatherin'? Somethin' off?
We goin' somewhere?
Fuck me, Saul. Brought me to the brink of a heart attack. Do your worst.
Jacket's incredible.
Listen, soon as we're back from Mikoshi, we'll celebrate - and I know just the place. My treat, of course.
Could've given me a heads up about this.
Yeah... It's nothin'. Don't worry about it.
Snug as a glove. Feels like I've been wearing it a while.
Thanks, Panam.
You, uh... mad at me?
Uhh, OK... Sorry I even brought it up.
What's this? Yard sale of some sort?
And the occasion would be...?
Worthy gesture. Dramatic, even.
What just happened - still can't quite wrap my head around it.
Sure she's ready?
Where we headed?
Fixable, ya thinks.
Seems so.
Let's head back.
You nervous about tomorrow?
Eh, why the hell not.
How?
Thought they banned chem-cocktails - during the war, even.
Weren't there outbreaks of cyberpsychosis within units?
So, not afraid of anything at this point?
C'mon. All in the family now, isn't it?
What about you?
What's your take? Saul oughta step down, pass the torch to Panam?
Mitch, not gonna be facing a ragtag band of Raffen or on exposed convoy. If we wanna get out of this op alive, they need to have their shit together.
Least tell me Saul offered Panam a seat at the table.
Think I get it. Panam's about the clan, not power. Question is whether she can reconcile the two.
Possible loot from Mikoshi?
Panam'll lose her chance at taking the helm.
Blame falls on Panam. She's the one brought me into the fold.
Right. Happy huntin', Mitch.
You think we'll pull through tomorrow?
Yeah. I bet they will. Goodnight, Saul.
Hmm?
Saul...
You're helpin' 'cause you got no choice. Want the clan to think you and Panam are actin' as one. In other words, you're playin' politics.
But for the good of the clan. I get it.
How about us, Saul? We good?
Revolver, empty bottles, middle o' nowhere - perfect.
Mind if join ya? Doubt I even remember what it's like not to hear my mind churnin' away.
Let's find out.
"The trick is to hear silence in your mind at the bang." Learned somethin’ after all.
Thanks, Cass.
Break a leg tomorrow.
What's this ritual about?
Ah, that kind.
I'll take a swig.  Well, well, not bad.
You think it's really that bad between 'em?
Had it up to here with the Panam versus Saul debate.
How're things with you guys?
Can promise you one thing. Aldecaldos will survive. Make sure of it myself.
All right, best be goin’. See you tomorrow.
How're things, Jake? All good?
Hey. Know any Samurai songs?
So this is where you escape to when you need to think.
Somethin's gnawin' at you, I can tell. Whatever it is, you can tell me.
Panam.
What's eatin' ya?
You feel responsible for them. Who in their right mind wouldn't?
Be right there with you tomorrow. Whatever happens, we'll be together we'll manage.
You'd do what you needed to.
Yeah?
Not as much as I'm afraid for you.
C'mere.
Enny for your thoughts?
Before another likely shouting match with Saul.
Did it?
I could sit here with you all night.
Looks like everyone's ready.
The tension?
Get any sleep at all?
Thanks.
And if we're too slow?
Sounds good so far. What else?
Think I've seen enough.
How'll we get back from there?
Ready as I'll ever be.
On the drones! You deal with the panzer!
You got it, can you put it out? Get the fuck out if not!
We can do this, Panam, hang in there.
We can do this.
There anything you can do about it?
We'll provide cover. Just hurry, all right?!
Copy that.
What about security protocols?
We'll handle them.
Saul, Mitch, headin' back your way.
'Kay..
This is not how it was supposed to go. Worried it's just gonna get worse.
Panam, if we... If you and I…
A bit, yeah.
And if you'd known how this'd turn out?
Mhm, Alt.
Well, kinda funny story, actually. Alt is Johnny's ex.
God's honest truth. But nobody moves through the net quite like she does. She's our only way into Mikoshi proper.
No. But it's not like I've got any other option. Just gotta hope Alt isn't hidin' anything, doesn't got other plans. Why, you worried?
Things'll work out. They gotta. Come too far for 'em not to.
How much farther to Arasaka Tower?
Mitch is right. The three of us've still got a decent shot. But without him, they've got none.
Moment of truth - here it goes.
It's drillin'!
Panam? Panam, everything all right? Panam?! Talk to me! No, no, no, no... Panam?!
Panam... For a sec I thought you'd...
Means we're still below the basement.
Ughh... I--I can't...
Agargh!
Got it... under control... Can't stop now. Anyone know where we are?
What now? Alt's shard-need a port to jack it into.
OK, I'm here. Alt, the shard's in.
How much time do you need to--
So we can keep going? To Mikoshi?
Thank you, Alt.
Likewise. Let's move.
It's the hush.
Think this is it. We made it.
Fuck!
Adam Smasher. I remember you. Promised to kill Silverhand once. Gonna let you in on a little secret. Johnny? He's here with us. Now, he can't talk, but I can feel him under my skin.
In the end, got you - Silverhand triumphs.
I'll make it.
I can do this.
Hey, Johnny. All packed, you washout? Got your one-way ticket?
Y'know, discovered one nice thing about becomin' Johnny Silverhand. You stop givin' the slimmest shit about Johnny Silverhand.
Want a word with Alt first. Where is the wench?
What? Whaddaya mean?
Your output don't fuck around.
You real? You hit me with Soulkiller?l ‘Thout asking?!
Jesus fuck, I'd've liked a warning at least...
Wait, hold on. I wanna know what the hell happened to me. Exactly!
You two still plan to obliterate Mikoshi?
What about everyone locked away there?
Cut the crop. You'll gobble 'em up like so many morsels of code, make 'em part of you.
So that's really it. We're done. You kept your word.
Christ, will you just skip to the end?!
Had this planned all along, didn't ya? Never had any intention of keepin' me alive.
You backstabbin' motherfucker! You just fuckin' kicked back, dumbass grin on your face, and you waited till I finally realized you had me fucked from the start.
Alt, question. Will the body reject Johnny's construct?
I ca-- I can't believe it. Everything. All we did - it was pointless. I've had enough of this. Of everything. You most of all.
Where's she even gonna take you?
What's it like, beyond the Blackwall?
What about hangin' around as a construct? Just till we find another way?
Jesus, to be a shapeless shadow in a digital afterlife... Really think I'd rather die.
No, be left with fading memories... of sharing a bed, headsplitting hangovers, sea breeze on my face, sun's heat on my shoulders... No.
Didn't think life was worth clinging to. Not at any price, anyway.
Wrong. That light beyond the Blackwall, see? That's hope. Could be the flames of hell or heaven's grace. Might also be an engram reading code. But it's a promise of survival.
Is there really no other way?
Guess I meant, I dunno... a happier ending for everyone involved.
Alt? If you were me, heh... what would you do?
What's that mean for me, exactly? Am I gonna... become like you?
And you?
I told you... I said I wanted you to have my body. But... but I can't do it... I'm sorry.
This dam... remember it well. Our beginnings.
What did you make of me?
I was. We both were. Bet you had no idea we'd end up like this, though.
Doe’n't matter, don't think. We'll forget it all tanning our backsides in the Arizona sun. Time and perspective - need a bit of both.
Should've done this long ago - gotten some perspective... on the city, my life there.
Panam, after Mikoshi, everything there... I'm glad we made it... here... together. And that we're leavin’ ... together.
Used to think of it as my city. Bonded together - I owned it, it owned me... Nothing to keep me there now, though.
Thought the city would help us see ourselves for who we were. Both of us.
Almost everything.
But we're getting out. At last. Placing our bets on something better somewhere else.
Gonna figure this out, Panam. Vik's drug helps a bit now. And once we get to where we're goin'. we'll try all your contacts.
Good to hear, it really is. Speaking of which, what about our plan?
Let's get outta here.
Well Night City - good night and good luck.
And our souvenirs from Mikoshi?
Just realized - here I am, kleppin' from Arasaka again.
We better. New beginnings can be rough.
What's that?
Seriously?
Just realized - already bringin’ everything I could possibly miss.
But it works doesn't it? Say it, say it works.
I know.
Mitch! Hey!
Good to hear you, choom! How's things?
Did save every one of our asses, though.
Gave us all a chance at a new start. Let's not fuck it up.
It's that storm. Gettin' close.
Hey, Mitch.
All plans laid and in place?
OK.
Heh. Can always count on getting complimented when you're around. Seems the great outdoors and fresh air've done you a lot of good, old man. Kept you spry.
Got a feeling I'm about to learn it.
I do. Believe I always did.
Why? Thought I'd stay in Night City?
Get to know me better, could change your mind. Need any help preparin'?
All right. So the plan, one more time.
So you found a gate in the wall. Clever.
Look, tunnel's cool and all, but we gotta get there first. And what about security up and down the border? Whole area's brimmin' with tech. Drones on perpetual patrol. Heavier stuff, too, maybe.
And nobody's likely to spot us?
Got bigger concerns then us. And even if they don't just let 'em try and catch us. They'll regret it. Great, and once we've crossed, what then?
And once there, we call the shots, right?
Hm, so even if I wanted to, got nothin' to worry about.
Looks like I've got a debt of gratitude to pay now.
Mhm.
You got it.
Think that's best avoided.
What?
Yeah, think I know what comes next - once you wound up on the other side and nothin' changed, you thought Night City was the answer, everything would change there.
No. Might be the same place on the other side, some space. But you're different, totally different.
Been ready always.
Got nothin' left to say. Start 'er up, the wheel is yours.
Don't slow down, Panam. Not yet.
It's perfect - all great, Panam. We're goin' home.
Gonna try to ask Panam for help.
Just... hold on a minute - need to think. There is another option, y'know.
We put all this - the pills, everything - to bed.
I know. Exactly why I will do one last thing.
Sure do.
Cleanest, least bloody option. We try anything else, people'll die. We try anything else, people'll die.
Am I worth their sacrifice? Are you? Sides, it's the only way we'll both be aware.
Mhm. The moment life escapes.
Might be somethin' I learned from you.
Long as you got nothin' against it.
Just like that? No pushback?
Y’know, it really is beautiful.
Yeah... With you, too, Johnny…
Stop. Just stop.
Yeah. Just don't freak out.
Could be my last ride, this. If it don't work out…
Just wanna be there for it, aware.
See you inside Mikoshi.
Johnny? … Kay. Just me now.
Your offer - I accept.
Whaddaya mean?
Locked you in?
Think Yorinobu knows?

Sounds bad. What now?
At Viktor's, my ripperdoc. Back behind a small shop called Misty's Esoterica.
Yeah, it's me.

Waitin' for my driver.
Who do we have here, huh?

Sure, why not.

OK, I'm ready.
Heheh, what a surprise...
Sounds like Johnny.
OK, definitely Johnny. He is one great disturbance.
Got another deck lyin' around? A cheerful one?
OK. And Johnny's?
Well... That doesn't sound too bad, right?
That's right.
Think I don't remember?  Don't like it any more than you do, but all the other options were worse.

Got no right to judge me.
Feel like shit. And it's gettin' worse…
Compared to you, I do. You look good.
Yes, but he's suppressed now. With beta-blockers. But before I did that, he warned me against working with Arasaka. So tuck your suspicions where the sun don't shine before I start regretting not taking his advice.
Johnny's my concern, not yours. This was my decision. He didn't play a part. Gave you my trust once, Takemura. Now do the same for me.
None of us did, matter of fact.
Don't remember conkin' out...
To 1

I don't have time for this, sir! Hanako Arasaka is expecting us!

Grr, couldn't be worse… Backup'll get here in seconds.
What now?
Uh-huh. We "neutralize."
We have a job to do. Need to keep it together, for all our sakes!
Did what we had to.
War's… a bit much, innit? Though a loaded word for any Arasaka.
Just counting bodies. You, me, Goro and Hellman makes four. Actually, three and a half.
Pretty quick to get back on his feet.
It was him or me, Hanako.
Anyway, against all Arasaka and its armies? That's not much.
That supposed to make me feel better? Reality is we're on our own.
Might help clear my head.
Huh, weird...
It’s flavorless.
Meaning what?
Any of it reversible?
Not thirsty anymore.
No, thanks. My hands are fine.
Just tired.
Ugh, felt better.
Get these, uh... blackouts...
Thanks.
Probably won't get another chance.
To fill me in on your plan.
Don't play dumb with me, Hanako.
That's how we're swinging the Arasaka board? You want me to stare at them?
If my charms don't work, we go for more tried-and-tested methods. I see what you're getting at.
Was in counterintel a while. Never heard of this place, though.
Hang on, is this...?
Was.
Meant to say "was."
Honestly? Wishful thinking at best.
My testimony's worth shit here. And not as if you've got much leverage, either.
Odds of that happening are...?
Won't have a choice. Corp's future is on the line. - They've got no choice. We're talking about the future of Arasaka here. A monolith whose first crack appeared with Yorinobu. Goro's words, not mine.
Don't blame yourself.
We're going down...?
Huh?
Keep gettin' this weird feeling you're not telling me the whole truth.
Thought you said we trusted each other.
Uh, whose?
What?!
Fuck me dizzy...
Never signed up for this!
Bullshit!
Could've given me a heads up.
Why?
Why am I here?
Because...?
Doin' this for myself alone. And not about to end up beyond a glass pane.
Thanks won't be near enough.
If you think I'll talk to you - forget it.
Made a deal with Hanako, not you.
Got that right, you bastard!
Silverhand sends his regards.
Let's get outta here.
I... Johnny, fuck no... Not now!
Ahem, on a downward spiral, but... I gotta try.
Don't have a fuckin' choice, now, do I?
I'll be calm when all this is over!
Ugh, growin' weaker by the minute. We gotta hurry.
Got a good memory for faces, Oda.
You in on this?
Saburo's comeback. Just spoke to his construct.
He digitized his engram, made copies. In case he died.
Why? So you'd take your job as his bodyguard lightly?
Feel that, Goro? Night City just gave you another kick in the nuts - running start this time.
Then what? Need me to "neutralize" them, too?
Hear that? Plant your ass somewhere else.
May I...? Everyone's waiting.
Much obliged.
It's true - all of it. Saw it with my own eyes.
I saw Yorinobu strangle Saburo Arasaka.
You lapped up Yorinobu's lies eagerly like the dogs you are. Convenient to be so docile?
Great idea. They can go straight to Yorinobu and ask him what happened at Konpeki Plaza. Just make sure they're armed. Your boss starts strangling people when he gets mad.
Saburo Arasaka is murdered, and you don't order an inquiry into the cause of his death.
Used to work a few floors down - Abernathy's department. And I know "shrugging your shoulders and finding a scapegoat" just isn't correct procedure when the CEO dies. I'm an eyewitness to what happened. You should ask me questions, then proceed with apprehending Yorinobu.
"Neutralize" us.
Alive? After all this?
Won't be long, now. We'll nab him.
You're all ratshit crazy, here.
Can't be nice, not anymore. We attack — full force.
Nah, Yorinobu expects that. Sly and quiet, that's us.
Got a problem. They've disabled all the elevators.
Guards are taken care of.
Well, they haven't met me yet.
As if they were gonna make this easy.
Adam Smasher! I fucking knew it!
Trust me, I know!
Adam Smasher... finally done and gone.
What's... your take, Johnny? Son of a bitch... is basically scrap. S'pose... it'll have to do. And Smasher... Don't bother tryna get up... You pile o' junk...
It's never... too late. Something... to think about.:
Heheh… How about that, Johnny? That was for you.
Thanks, Goro... can’t believe... we actually pulled it off.
Do yourself a favor, Goro. Ghost... get outta here.
Forget Arasaka.
Don’t you get it...? You were Saburo’s bodyguard... and you failed him.
Think they gonna raise their glasses... to you?
Hit the streets, disappear... get gigs, fed cats... Just stay clear of Arasaka.
Mean your beloved sibling...? One your men... almost shot and killed?
Be here... any sec, now. Till then... supposed to watch you... so don’t try anything.
This... yu won’t need.
A guy... who lost.
Terror. And deaths... that could’ve been... avoided.
Know what I see...? A corporate coup... that failed. Your men out there... spillin' blood... for no reason… V: You’ve lost...
A chance...? A chance for what...?
:This is nonsense...
:This how you wanna help people... forget their fear? By killing them? Sorry... just don’t get it.
Saburo.
Wouldn’ta changed... a damn thing. You’re exactly like him... All you want... is power.
To think you once dared to lead your own gang... But dropped all that, all your dreams, ideals... to seek power.
You're even worse... than him. Saburo ruled... with an iron fist, but he didn't... need a purge... to hold onto power.
Not much.
Not all... not yet!
And you?
Where's... what... where's Johnny?
So...?
I'm-I'm hearin'... purple. What the... ?
I think I'm gonna be sick...
Having... trouble remembering... how I got here.
I... I'm alive. I'm really alive! It worked...
Am... am I still V? I-I died. Twice. I...
No...
I just... I just wanna sleep.
I... Who am I?
I want out of here.
I feel... empty. As if I was being pulled... stretched.
Huh?
No "good morning"? No, "Got some good news for ya"?
"And it was a sight to behold, he said, how a soul would choose its life. Sometimes pitiable, sometimes laughable, at times wonderful and strange..."
Higher-order representation what?
What's this thingamajig for?
What're these tests meant to... test?
What?
Johnny.
Life.
Odyssey.
Freedom.
Orbit.




What's this test for anyway?
What's wrong with me?
That's enough.
How did I do?
What's this test all about?
What's this s'posed to prove? I already know I can walk.
How am I doing?
Shit...
Any results from the tests you already did?
Startin' to get sick of this.
Fine. Hit me. Let's get this done.
Same thing? Again?
Why can't I solve the fucking cube?
Let's start this thing.
As quick as I can, no thinking, got it.
[Me - Johnny - Life - The city - Death - I Dunno]
[Me - Johnny - Life - Death - Nothing - I dunno]
[Johnny - Emptiness - Death - Transformation - Solitude - I dunno]
[Hell - A void - Arasaka - Solitude - Death - No notion]
[No idea - Arasaka - the city - No association - Rebellion - Death]
"The heat has made your mouth dry and sticky. You spot a rodents' nest at your feet."
"A shadow gradually covers the ground. The first raincloud of the year."
Right. Enough.
Really aced it last time, didn't I?
No. No point to this.
Look, I know my body. Won't last long on this thing.
Not bad so far, huh? Try a little faster.
I... I can't. Gotta stop.
How's it going?
Got rid of the biochip.
Yeah. Sittin' on their orbital station.
How's Misty?
Tell her I said hi when she gets back.
Yeah, so, to be honest, been better.
I just wanted to talk, Vik.
What am I supposed to do?
Yeah. Thanks for the pep talk, Vik. Sounds like a plan.
Hey.
Wait, what? What's the problem?
Hey, stop yelling at me.
Sitting on an Arasaka orbital station. No idea which one.
Nice to hear your voice again.
Hey, listen. These tests - gonna go on much longer?
[Nope. Had enough. - Johnny - Arasaka - Me - Betrayal - Dunno]
Quick as I can, no thinking, right.
Enough. No more tests. I refuse to take any.
[Johnny - Arasaka - Me - Nothing - No clue]

No.
No!

Fuck! No! Enough!  I've had it! Fucking hate this place!
Shit. It worked.
[Sit - What're you doin' here?] Takemura? What're you doin' here?
[Sit - Blunt, as usual.] Takemura. Blunt as usual.
Come all the way to take me home?
What're you gonna do now? Still aim to protect Saburo's ass?
Why?
Saw Saburo Arasaka's back. In Yorinobu's body.
So - got your revenge? Feel satisfied?
Whole family's all kind of fucked up. You know that.
Sister kills brother to plant her murdered dad in the brother's corpse? Straight-to-feeder flick right there.
Saburo shoulda stayed dead.
Sorry, guess I'll never understand what you see in the guy.
Y'know, the Arasakas belong in some sad old tragedy. Some Shakespeare-level shit there. Yorinobu 'specially.
Wanted out of his dad's shadow, whatever the cost. Died at the hand of his worst nightmare.
Fine, so what is it you got to tell me?
How… How is that possible? Arasaka's got the best and brightest!
This is fuckin' Arasaka! They should figure something out!
Sorry, don't believe you.
I… I really thought it'd all work out, end better than well.
Fuck.
Said Arasaka would fix me if I helped you -- you promised.
Said you had powerful friends. Where're those friends now?
Hanako Arasaka promised to save my life.
Dead in a few months -- that's me, huh?
Fuck.
What're you talkin' about? Trusted you all once already. You let me down.
Store? Can’t I get a new body right off?
Seemed pretty damn possible for Saburo Arasaka.
Sorry, not buyin' it. Arasaka's out to lock me up.
Nope, doesn’t sound good at all to me. I agree to this, and they’ll do whatever they want with me.
[Take contract - take the datapad from him]
So I get to be corporate property first?
And if I say no?
Made my decision.
Goin’ back to Earth, goin’ home.
You’re all right, Takemura, I like you. Thanks for comin’ all the way up here to help.
But one thing you never understood and never will.
Got no idea how sweet it is to be free.
No. This here’s goodbye. But I’m not gonna forget you, what we did together.
Don't wanna die.
[Stand - See you around?] Gonna see each other again?
So... see you.
Hey. What's your name?
Hajime, lemme ask you somethin'. What would you say to a person who walked right into their greatest foe's jail to save their life?
Just a sec. Be right back.
Thanks for your concern. Let's start this rodeo.
Clearly havin' an off-day.
Know what, Wilson? Kiss my ass.
See ya 'round, Wilson. Till next time.
Hey, you OK? Somethin' wrong?
Thanks, Wilson. Sure is pretty.
See ya 'round, Wilson. Till next time.
Hey, you OK? Somethin' wrong?
Should try not calling potential buyers "bush-league."
